 <p class="indent">"<span class="smcap">Lieutenant-Colonel Sandilands</span> of
 the 7th Camerons arrived on the hill. Being
 the senior officer present, he took command
 and planted the Headquarters flag of his
 Battalion on the top. It was his business
 to recall the van of the advance, now lost
 in the fog and smoke of the eastern slopes,
 and to entrench himself on the summit.
 The Redoubt was now out of our hands
 and the line taken ran just under the crest
 on the west, and was continued North of
 Loos by the 46th Brigade. To retire the van
 was no light task. Two officers whose
 names deserve to be remembered, Major
 Chrichton of the 10th Gordons, and Major
 Barron of the 7th Camerons, volunteered
 for the desperate mission. They fell in the
 task, but the order reached the stragglers, and
 they began to fight their way back. In
 the midst of encircling fire it was a forlorn
 hope, and few returned to the British lines
 on the hill. All down the slopes towards
 Loos lay the tartans Gordon and Black
 Watch, Seaforth and Cameron, like the
 drift left on the shore when the tide has
 ebbed."&mdash;<i>John Buchan, in "Nelson's History
 of the War."</i></p>

Division for two years and a quarter, I have
followed with deep interest this history of the
7th Cameron Highlanders.</p>

<p>I am convinced that all who read of the
gallant deeds performed by this Battalion, in
company with the other Battalions of the 15th
(Scottish) Division, in the service of their King
and Country, will be stirred with an intense
feeling of pride in the achievements of their
countrymen recorded in this little book.</p>

<p>The Battalion has indeed nobly maintained
the splendid traditions of the Queen's Own
Cameron Highlanders.</p>

<p class="gap-above nodent"><span class="smcap">This</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
is a great story. A narrative of the
adventures in training camps, in billets and
trenches, in battles and in periods of rest, of
one of the units of that splendid body of men
known as the "New Armies" which sprang
into being in 1914 under the inspiration of
Lord Kitchener. A story of comradeship,
endeavour and sacrifice in the great cause.</p>

<p>By far the greater part of it deals with the
periods of fighting, and it is doubtful whether
any of the New Army units saw more, for the
famous 15th Scottish Division, of which the
7th Camerons formed part, was one of the
earliest of the new divisions to go to the front
and take a place in the line, and its record
includes the battles of Loos, the Somme, Arras
1917, Ypres 1917, the German attack on Arras
in 1918, and the capture of Buzancy in the
Soissons area in August 1918, as part of the
10th French Army under General Mangin.</p>

<p>I had two opportunities during the war of
judging the fighting qualities of the 15th
Division. The first was when serving with the
1st Division, which attacked alongside the
15th at Loos. The energy and enthusiasm with
which the Scotsmen prepared for the attack,
and the dash and determination with which they
executed it, excited the highest admiration of
their regular comrades of the 1st Division.
The two divisions served in the same Corps for
some months in the ensuing winter, succeeding
each other in and out of the water-logged trench
lines of the Loos Salient, and the admiration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">{11}</a></span>
aroused by their action in the battle was
deepened by the observation of their soldierly
qualities under the trying conditions of trench
warfare in winter.</p>

<p>The second time I was a more intimate
observer, for I had the supreme privilege of
being appointed to the command of the 15th
Division in June, 1917, just as it was entering
the Ypres Salient to take part in the desperate
and bloody fighting of the efforts to capture
the Passchendaele Ridge. Its personnel had
largely changed, owing to the casualties of the
Somme and Arras, but the Scottish fighting
spirit was there still, and the dour and stubborn
valour with which, after seizing and holding the
Frezenberg Ridge, they essayed again and again
to win the concrete defences of Borry Farm, Beck
House, Iberian House, etc., under indescribable
conditions of mud, shell-fire and gas, forms a
story which has not yet been fully told.</p>

<p>In this fighting, as in all the other operations
of the Division, the 7th Camerons bore a full and
gallant share. The last of the German efforts
to retake the Frezenberg Ridge was broken up
by a skilfully led counter-attack by a company
of this Battalion with one of the 8th Seaforths.</p>

<p>The last time I saw the 7th Camerons was
after the return of the Division to the Arras
Sector in September, 1917, when they were
encamped in Blangy Park in the Scarpe Valley.
To men who had been through what they had
it was, as the narrator says, a delightful change
and rest. But rest, although more than well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span>
earned, was not accompanied by any slackness
or loss of discipline. I was particularly struck
by the state of their camp, its excellent order
and cleanliness; cooking and sanitary arrangements
all that they should be, the men healthy
and in good spirits. A rapid recovery after
heavy fighting is a mark of a first-class battalion.</p>

<p>Colonel Norman Macleod had the good
fortune to serve with the Battalion from the day
it crossed the Channel till it was amalgamated
with the 6th Camerons in June, 1918 (except
a short time when recovering from wounds). He
commanded it for 15 months, and subsequently
commanded the combined 6th/7th Battalion
until the end. It would be a record of which
any one might well be proud merely to have
taken part in the great events comprised in
that period, but to have commanded this
splendid battalion, and to have been with it
from its first raising in Scotland to its victorious
entry into Brussels after the armistice, during
all the period it was gathering its imperishable
laurels and adding lustre to the name of
the historic regiment whose name it bears,
is an honour which he probably would not
change for any other, however high.</p>

<p>It is well that such stories should be told.
To the survivors of the events they narrate
they are a reminder of great days and great
friendships. To future generations of Scottish
lads they will be an inspiration.</p>

<p class="gap-above nodent"><span class="smcap">This</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
modest record of the services of a great
battalion in the Great War adds yet another
page to the glorious history of "The Queen's
Own" Cameron Highlanders.</p>

<p>I had the honour to command the 15th
(Scottish) Division from October, 1917, to March,
1918. During the first year of that period
this Battalion, or perhaps I should say these
Battalions, for the 6th, the 7th and the 6/7th
Cameron Highlanders are almost inseparable
in my mind, were most severely tried on many
occasions in battle, most notably in front of
Arras in March, 1918, and South of Soissons in
July, 1918.</p>

<p>The authors state that the battle of the 28th
March, 1918, was probably the heaviest fighting
in which the 7th Battalion ever took part.
Lieut.-General Sir Charles Fergusson, Commanding
the XVII. Corps, when the great German
attack was foreseen, had warned the 15th
Division that it was in a "Post of Honour,"
adding: "I am glad that it is in the hands of a
Scottish Division, who I know will never let the
enemy pass." Again on the 29th March, after
the great attack, General Fergusson wired:
"I knew you could be relied on to stick it out
to the end. There are fresh troops in support
of you now, but I want the honour of holding
Arras to be yours alone."</p>

<p>General Ludendorff, in his <i>Memoirs</i>, practically
attributes the turning point of his hopes
of success to the failure of the 17th German
Army to capture the heights East and North
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{14}</a></span>
of Arras, this "in spite of employing a vast
amount of artillery and ammunition." I am
sure all comrades of the 15th (Scottish) Division
will agree that no unit of ours deserved more
credit for stopping the Germans in front of
Arras than the 7th Cameron Highlanders.</p>

<p>During the period, December, 1918, to March,
1919, the troops were tried in a different way.
A time of absolute inactivity prevailed in
Belgium, with many temptations for all ranks
to be slack and to allow discipline to deteriorate.
A natural reaction after the strain of war.
There was also a feeling, rightly or wrongly,
that in the system of demobilisation length of
service at the front was not always considered.
During this difficult time the 6/7th Cameron
Highlanders retained their splendid discipline
and still upheld their claim to the nickname
"The Shiny Seventh."</p>

<p>The authors refer to their firm belief in the
advantages of the kilt as a service dress.
Opinions may differ on this point, but there is
no question as to the prestige and confidence
which the kilt carries with it.</p>

<p>When we moved suddenly to join the Xth
French Army in July, 1918, the British troops
were, for some reason, temporarily out of favour
in that area, but the sight of the Highlanders,
and the sound of the bagpipes, changed this
feeling at once, and nothing could have exceeded
the enthusiasm with which the 15th Division
was received in billets during this period of
operations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>
Again, on the coldest of days in January,
1919, when troops of three Divisions marched
past His Majesty, the King of the Belgians, in
Brussels, there was a sudden roar of applause
from the half-frozen crowd as the kilted pipers
leading the 45th Infantry Brigade, which represented
the infantry of the 15th Division,
approached. The 6/7th Cameron Highlanders
swung past; His Majesty turned to me and said:
"Truly magnificent soldiers." Those who read
this narrative will agree that this splendid tribute
was deserved.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 1.<br />
    EARLY DAYS.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Soon</span>
after the outbreak of the Great War,
Colonel D. W. Cameron of Lochiel
received permission to raise Service
Battalions of the Cameron Highlanders under
Lord Kitchener's New Army Scheme. He proceeded
at once to Scotland, and at meetings in
Glasgow and Inverness stirring appeals for
recruits for the new Battalions were made.
These appeals met with so enthusiastic a response
that within a week or two the 5th and
6th Battalions were raised, and recruiting for
the 7th Battalion was in full swing. Recruits
for the 5th and 6th were sent direct to Aldershot,
but when it was found that there was
every prospect of raising another Battalion, it
was decided to make its Headquarters at Inverness,
the Capital of the Territorial District of
the Cameron Highlanders.</p>

<p>From the outset, Major Seymour Clarke of
the Cameron Highlanders, who had returned
to duty at the Cameron Depot at Inverness
on the outbreak of war, took a great interest
in the Battalion, and he did much for it during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">{18}</a></span>
its early days in Inverness. On 8th October,
1914, Lieutenant-Colonel D. P. Haig, who
formerly commanded the 3rd Battalion, was
gazetted as the first Commanding Officer of the
7th, but the date of the birth of the Battalion
may be said to be 28th September, 1914, on
which day Captain James Barron, Captain
Mackenzie-Gillanders, and Lieutenant W. H.
Kirkland were gazetted to the Battalion. On
30th September, Captain C. D. Stewart, and on
5th October, Captain Norman Macleod, were
also gazetted. Unfortunately, Captain Mackenzie-Gillanders
and Captain C. D. Stewart
were very shortly afterwards invalided out of
the service, and for several weeks the Battalion
had to carry on with Lieutenant-Colonel Haig
and Captains Barron and Macleod as the only
senior officers. Captain Barron acted as
Adjutant of the Battalion until shortly before
it went to France, where he fell at the Battle of
Loos while Second in Command; Captain
Macleod served with the Battalion throughout
most of the War, commanding it for the last
18 months of its existence, and Lieutenant
Kirkland fell while commanding a Company at
Loos.</p>

<p>The two months spent by the Battalion at
Inverness were very strenuous but very happy.
It was soon recruited up to full strength, and
the type of man it attracted was of a particularly
high order and fine physique, as at this
time the height and chest measurement for
recruits had been increased. A large proportion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>
were students and young professional
men from Glasgow, where a Cameron Recruiting
Office had been opened as soon as Lochiel
received permission to raise the new Battalions,
and it was a rule that no man was admitted
unless he was a Scotsman. A considerable
number of recruits also came from Inverness-shire,
including not a few from the town of
Inverness, where the Battalion was immensely
popular. The Cameron Barracks were, of course,
too small to accommodate more than a small
proportion of the Battalion, but quarters were
found for many in a distillery hard by. Here
the comforts of life were lacking, many
men having to sleep on a stone floor with
only one blanket, but so fine was the spirit of
the men that there was little or no grousing.
The good people of Inverness, too, vied with
one another in doing everything possible for all
ranks. The hospitality extended to officers
and men alike was unbounded, and many
citizens earned the undying gratitude of the
Battalion by placing their private baths at
their disposal. Moreover, nearly all the halls
in the town were formed into Clubs for the use
of the men, and in these refreshments were
dispensed in right royal fashion. No man
who served with the Battalion during these
two months is ever likely to forget the porridge
and milk, which, in response to a well-nigh
universal demand, came to be regarded as the
<i>piece de resistance</i> on these occasions.</p>

<p>The first route march of the Battalion was,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
appropriately enough, to Culloden Moor. Then,
and for several months thereafter, the men
were in civilian clothes: but as time went on
(so great was the keenness to wear the kilt)
many members supplied themselves with
the Cameron Service Dress at their own expense.
By and by week-end leave was granted,
but no 7th Cameron wanted to go on leave in
"civvies." Few kilts were available at that
time, even for those who were eager and willing
to buy them, but there was, happily, a nucleus
of Regulars at the Barracks who boasted the
coveted garb. A tentative suggestion that
these proud wearers of the kilt might perchance
hire them out to their New Army brethren
who were going on leave, met with a ready
acquiescence, and so rapidly did the idea catch
on that kilts were often booked for weeks ahead.
But if a Cameron Highlander is incomplete
without a kilt, so is a Cameron Battalion without
a Pipe Band. Fortunately, one of the
band boys at the Barracks, the son of an old
Pipe-Major, was able to play the pipes, and he
proudly strutted in front of the Battalion on
its first route march to Culloden Moor. Before
long other pipers were discovered among the
recruits, and the time the Battalion left
Inverness it could boast quite a respectable
Pipe Band.</p>

<p>On 30th November the Battalion left Inverness
for Aldershot. It was with many regrets
that it said farewell to the "Capital of the
Highlands," where it had been so kindly treated,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
and where the men had won golden opinions
by their behaviour and discipline. In a farewell
letter to Colonel Haig the Provost
expressed the feeling of the citizens in the
following terms:&mdash;</p>

 <p class="nodent indent">"The men of the Battalion have by their exemplary conduct,
 and their manly and courteous bearing, won favour on all
 hands, and it is with regret we realise that we are no longer
 going to have them in our midst."</p>

<p>The Battalion arrived at Aldershot 1136
strong, and were quartered in the Salamanca
Barracks, which they shared with another
Battalion of the same strength, and where they
remained for several weeks. An unsolicited
testimonial was given to the physique of the
Battalion by an Instructor of the 5th Camerons,
who saw them march into Aldershot. He
declared that they were one of the finest bodies
of men, physically, he had ever seen. At
Aldershot a period of intensive training was
put in, and the Battalion benefited greatly
from the ministrations of Captain Crooks, a
splendid instructor and disciplinarian, who
voluntarily placed his services at its disposal.</p>

<p>Christmas and New Year were spent at
Aldershot. On 15th January, 1915, the Battalion
marched into billets at Liphook. The
long march was completed in full kit without
a single man falling out.</p>

<p>Here Major Norman MacLeod was posted to
the Battalion. He had served in the Calcutta
Light Horse, and for some time had acted as
Musketry Instructor to the Brigade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span>
About this time the Battalion received its
first consignment of kilts, although, as we have
indicated, many of the men had already bought
the full uniform privately. Owing to the
difficulty of getting the different tartans and
keeping up a supply in France, the War Office
introduced an article called the "universal
kilt." It was made of grey-brown cloth,
pleated and sewn on to a waist-band of the
same material like a girl's skirt. It incorporated
all the disadvantages of a kilt without
any of the advantages. Luckily this monstrosity
was soon killed by the Highland Societies.</p>

<p>On 22nd February the 15th Division was
inspected on Frensham Common by a distinguished
French visitor under the most depressing
weather conditions, as it snowed and rained
alternately throughout the day.</p>

<p>The Battalion left Liphook and arrived at
Cirencester on the 25th February. The men
were practically all billeted in private houses,
and never were they more happy and fit than
in this fine old town. Who will ever forget the
splendid deer park, with its beautiful woods
and long, broad grass rides? But the kindness
of the people themselves will always be uppermost
in our minds. Another unique experience
we must record, as it betokens a large-minded
tolerance, which is to be the more
appreciated and acknowledged because of its
rarity even in these times. The two Scottish
Battalions could find no place large enough
for Divine Service, so the Authorities of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{23}</a></span>
Church of England were approached, and leave
was granted for 1200 men to worship in the
beautiful old Parish Church. They had their
own Presbyterian service under their own Presbyterian
chaplain, and the organist led the
praise with the old psalm tunes which Scotsmen
love so dearly. Had the grand old church,
with its lofty pillars, clerestory roof, and walls
enshrined with memorial tablets and coats of
arms, ever echoed before to such a service, so
impressive and unique? Not since the days
of Cromwell's Iron Rule, if even then, can the
preacher have seen from the pulpit such a sea
of manly faces and a sight so inspiring in its
character and its associations.</p>

<p>About 8 miles out from Cirencester was the
training area, to which we used to march in
the morning and return about 4 o'clock in the
afternoon, very often to fall in again about
9 or 10 p.m. for night operations. The men were
now so fit that, although they had had a strenuous
day, they would simply race home the 8
miles at night, singing and chaffing their comrades
in front in order to urge on the pace.
On 6th April the Battalion left Cirencester for
Chiseldon, which was a large hutted camp on
Salisbury Plain.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Haig, on the 22nd April,
received the appointment of Commandant of
the Staff Musketry Camp at Barry, Lieut.-Colonel
J. W. Sandilands, D.S.O., taking over
command the same day. It was with great
regret that the Battalion parted with Colonel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
Haig. He was a thorough gentleman and
sportsman, and no officer could have been found
better suited for the arduous work of handling
a Battalion raised under such peculiar circumstances.
Lieut.-Colonel J. W. Sandilands had
the advantage of having already been out at
the Front, where he had commanded a Company
in the 1st Battalion, and also the London
Scottish. Just previous to his taking over the
7th Battalion, he had been employed as Brigade
Major in the 46th Brigade of the 15th Division.</p>

<p>At Chiseldon the Battalion worked strenuously,
and were put through their musketry
course. On 12th May they marched to Park
House, which was a very similar camp to
Chiseldon. On 15th May the Brigade marched
past Lord Kitchener, who stated that it was
the finest, from a physical point of view, which
he had yet seen. On 3rd June the Battalion
won the 44th Brigade Championship in Highland
Games, for which a silver bugle was presented
by Brigadier-General M. Grant Wilkinson,
M.V.O. This bugle has, along with many other
prizes, since been presented to the Depot
Cameron Highlanders.</p>

<p>On Sunday, 4th July, orders were received
to proceed overseas. This news was the cause
of the greatest enthusiasm amongst the men,
who were eager to give practical proof of the
value of their training. On 8th July the
Battalion embarked on <span class="smcap">S.S.</span> "<i>Arundel</i>" at
Folkestone for Boulogne, and was entrained
for Houle, where a few days were spent. From
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
Houle it marched to Houchin, the men's feet
suffering considerably from new boots and
the paved roads. From Houchin we proceeded
to Les Brèbis as a detached Battalion,
and can therefore claim to be the first Battalion
of the 15th Division to enter the shelled
area on the Western front.</p>

<p>Les Brebis was being constantly shelled. It
was found almost impossible to keep the men
in their billets, as, being much interested in
this new experience, they would rush into the
streets whenever a shell burst, in order to see
the effect, and to collect fragments as souvenirs.
They very soon got tired of this habit.</p>

<p>On 21st July Lieut.-Colonel M'Dougall of
Lunga, who commanded the 10th Gordon
Highlanders, was killed while making a tour of
the trenches. He was buried at Houchin with
full Military Honours. Colonel M'Dougall was
a splendid type of Highland officer and gentleman,
and was the first officer casualty in the
Division.</p>

<p>On the night of the 2/3rd August we took
over the trenches for the first time at Maroc,
holding the extreme right of the British line.
Opposite to us were the now famous Towers of
Loos, from which the enemy had good observation
over our whole system. The Battalion
while in reserve in this sector was billeted in
Mazingarbe. While there a Church Parade
was held in the grounds of the Chateau, which
belonged to a rich mine owner of the district.
This, although within range of the enemy's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
guns, was most beautifully laid out with masses
of flowers and lovely lawns, through which a
burn ran with cascades and pools in which gold
fish sported. The owner resided here during
the whole War, and when the Battalion returned
in 1918 they found the garden as beautiful as
ever.</p>

<p>On the 30th August we proceeded to N&oelig;ux-les-Mines.
On return to the line the Battalion
sustained its first officer casualties. On the
9th September, Lieuts. W. G. Stuart, MacDonell,
and MacRae were wounded by trench
mortars. Three days later rather serious casualties
were caused by the enemy bombarding
a saphead which we held.</p>

<p>On the 12th the Battalion was relieved, and
went into billets at Verquin. The pipes and
drums played "Retreat" each evening in the
grounds of the mansion house, and also played
in Bethune on the afternoon of the 19th. On
the 18th the 4th Battalion marched through
Verquin on its way to the trenches, and was
given a very hearty reception by the 7th Battalion,
the band playing them through the
village.</p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">{27}</a></span></div>

<h2>CHAPTER 2.<br />
    THE BATTLE OF LOOS.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">On</span>
the 21st we again went into the trenches,
taking over the Grenay-Vermelles line, preparatory
to the Battle of Loos. Shelling had
now become intense, the bombardment being
in full swing. Before going into the line the
fact that the attack was going to take place was
kept most secret, nobody below the rank of
Company Commander being informed of the
project. We were, therefore, somewhat surprised
to learn, on getting into the line, that
the Germans knew all about it. In fact we were
told by those in the front line that the enemy
was shouting across to our trenches asking
what was the cause of the delay!</p>

<p>At 4.45 a.m. on the 25th the Battalion
moved out to take part in its first great battle,
a battle which is one of the greatest in the
history of Scotland, owing to the number of
Scottish troops employed. On that day there
were five battalions of Camerons engaged. The
morning was dull and misty, with practically
no wind. At 5.50 a.m. our gas was turned on,
and ran alternately with smoke candles. Owing
to the lack of wind, however, it is doubtful if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
the gas did not do more harm than good, numerous
British casualties being due to it. At 6.30
a.m. the assault was delivered, the 9th Black
Watch and 8th Seaforths leading, with the
7th Camerons in support, and the 10th Gordons
in reserve. The advance was practically due
East towards the Towers of Loos, these being
kept slightly on our right. Within a very short
time the Black Watch and Seaforths got clear
away.</p>

<p>The Camerons, following, were very shortly
streaming through the village of Loos, having
crossed the third German line of wire and
trenches, which had been regarded as impregnable.
Unfortunately, traces of the gallant
part played by the Camerons in cutting this wire,
which was almost untouched by Artillery fire,
were too evident, the ground being strewn with
dead and wounded. The houses in Loos were
practically battered to pieces. Germans were
being bombed out of the cellars, others bayoneted,
dozens were surrendering, but nothing seemed
to stay the advance of the 44th Brigade.</p>

<p>The Battalion Headquarters were established
in a red brick building near the church,
which was now a heap of ruins. There the
Commanding Officer, with the Signallers and
Scouts collected round him, remained in comparative
security until suddenly a number of
the heaviest type of high explosive shells rained
down on them. All dashed for a cellar,
in which was found a German soldier. Soon
after it was decided to go down into the lower
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span>
cellar, where we found a German officer still
telephoning. It was evident that he had
directed the Artillery fire upon our Headquarters.
His telephone apparatus was for a
long time afterwards in the possession of, and
used by, the Battalion Signallers.</p>

<p>As the Commanding Officer was going through
the village he came across two Companies of
the 7th Royal Scots Fusiliers, who attached
themselves to him, and all went on together to
Hill 70. On their arrival at the foot of the
Hill, information was received that 300/400
of the Brigade&mdash;most of them Camerons&mdash;had
pressed forward over the Hill and were heavily
engaged with the enemy's lines at St. Laurent.
It must be remembered that the orders
received before going into action were that the
Battalion was to press on to the Cité St. Auguste,
beside St. Laurent, which was given to them as
their final objective.</p>

<p>Major Crichton of the 10th Gordons handed
over the command of the Hill to Colonel Sandilands,
who, at once realising the gravity of the
situation, decided to establish a line on the
reverse slope of Hill 70. Luckily here there
was a sort of natural line of defence, consisting
of a bank about 3 feet high, running roughly
North and South along the Hill. This proved
an invaluable feature to hold on to, as men
instinctively rallied to it. Major Barron, 2nd
in command, 7th Camerons, and Major Crichton
(10th Gordons) volunteered to go forward
and order the advance party, who had charged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
over the Hill, to retire. Both officers fell in
the task, but their orders reached the advanced
line, and the men began to fight their way back.
Major Crichton was killed outright, while Major
Barron, who was wounded and taken prisoner,
died of his wounds in a German Field Hospital.</p>

<p>The Commanding Officer being satisfied that
his right was protected by the London Regiment
which was astride the Loos Crassier, ordered the
Royal Scots Fusiliers to dig in for all they
were worth. There is little doubt that if these
two Companies had not acted contrary to the
strict letter of their orders, in coming on with
Colonel Sandilands, things might have gone
badly with the 15th Division. About 8 a.m.
the Battalion Flag, which consisted of one of
the Divisional yellow distinguishing flags, with
a patch of Cameron tartan taken from an old
kilt sewn on to it, was planted on Hill 70, and
remained flying till midnight, when we withdrew.
Throughout the operations the flag was
carried by Scout-Sergeant Lamb, and on more
than one critical occasion he rallied men of all
regiments by waving them back to the Hill.
This flag has been presented to the Depot, and
is now in the Officers' Mess at Inverness. About
midnight, when the line had been fairly well
dug, those in front were ordered to retire. It
was on the forward slope of Hill 70 that the
greatest number of casualties in the 7th Camerons
occurred. The confusion which of necessity
arises after an assault of this nature can be
realised from the fact that on Hill 70 the Commanding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
Officer had under his command representatives
from no less than nine different
Battalions.</p>

<p>At 3 p.m. all were cheered by seeing large
bodies of troops coming over the Hill, apparently
to relieve us. They turned out to be part of
the 1st Division, who had been delayed in the
attack on our left, and not a relief. At 6 p.m.
word was received that we were to be relieved
by the 62nd Brigade, but owing to some error
they did not arrive until early next morning.</p>

<p>At 8 p.m. the Commanding Officer discussed
the situation with the Brigadier, and satisfied
him that the position on Hill 70 was secure for
the night, and, in view of the fact that the few
Camerons who still remained could not influence
the situation, received orders to hand over the
command to Lieut.-Colonel M'Lean of the
10th Royal Scots, and to withdraw his own men.
At midnight he ordered his little band of weary
Camerons to retire. Not many who came out
that night will very readily forget it. In
drenching rain, pools of mud, and incessant
shelling, they picked their way amongst the
dead by the light of burning houses, and they
plodded wearily on, powerless to take any
notice of the wounded who lay waiting for
stretcher-bearers. Mistaking the road, they
made a detour through Maroc, finally fetching
up at the old Headquarters, which, although it
consisted merely of a badly shelled house,
appeared like a sanctuary. Without calling a
proper Roll the men were numbered off, and it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">{32}</a></span>
was found that there were 4 officers and 75
other ranks present out of 20 officers and 827
rank and file who had started off so proudly
24 hours earlier. Throughout the night and
early morning stragglers kept coming in, and
there were finally collected 6 officers and about
290 other ranks.</p>

<p>Philosophe was reached about 3 a.m., and
we were lucky to find the cookers waiting for
us, and, after having some tea, both officers
and men slept on the ground, too exhausted to
take any notice of the mud or water. The
usual rumours of going back for a long rest were
prevalent, a rest which was often talked about
but never matured. However, about 8 a.m.
26th September, a Staff Officer came over and
said that the battle was going far from well,
and that there was no alternative but to send
the remnant of the Battalion back into the
fight. It is impossible to realise the feelings of
men under such circumstances. They fell in,
and went straight back, picking their way
through Quality Street, which by this time was
literally running with blood and blocked with
wounded. On they went amidst a hail of gas
shells, pushing their way through bunches of
disorganised troops&mdash;raw recruits who had
never before experienced the sights of a battlefield,
and arriving finally at the old German
front-line, where they found the trench so full
of gas that they had to dig themselves in behind
the parados. They held this position well on
into the Monday morning, when they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
finally relieved. Twenty-four hours after this
these men marched out of Mazingarbe, headed
by the pipes and drums, with their buttons
cleaned and their equipment polished in so
smart a manner that they were mistaken for
a new draft, and were greeted with shouts from
those whom they passed: "Wait till you have
been in the trenches, and you won't look like
that."</p>

<p class="date">"<span class="smcap">Invergordon</span>, <i>12th October, 1915</i>.</p>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smcap">Dear Sandilands</span>,</p>

<p>"Let me express the feelings of all here. We are proud of
the dash and gallantry shewn by the 7th Battalion Cameron Highlanders
under your command at the taking of Hill 70 at the Battle
of Loos. To command such officers and men is indeed enviable&mdash;they
have added fresh glory to the Cameron Highlanders, and their
deeds will live in history.</p>

<p>"From my son, who was A.D.C. to General Sir Arthur Paget,
Commanding the Salisbury Division, I heard what Field Marshal
Lord Kitchener said about the 7th Battalion: 'It is far the finest
Battalion of the new Army I have seen,' no mean compliment
from such an authority who knows how to judge soldiers.</p>

The next three days were spent in the support
line, which was not very much more comfortable,
but distinctly safer. The following
three days we had a bad time. The rain came
down in torrents during the relief, and continued
incessantly for 40 hours. It is very
difficult even to imagine the misery and discomfort
which the men suffered. The so-called
trenches were full of water and mud up to the
men's knees. It was almost impossible for the
ration and water parties to get either up or
down.</p>

<p>During the second afternoon of this downpour
the German Artillery got on to our front line
trench, blew in a machine-gun emplacement
and knocked down a considerable portion of the
parapet, one man being killed and two wounded.
The parapet was rebuilt during the night.
Next morning nothing particular happened, but
in the afternoon the German guns again opened
a heavy enfilade fire, resulting in 11 men being
killed and 21 wounded, and the parapet being
very badly knocked about. It was a very trying
experience for new troops, and there is little
doubt that the Battalion deserved great credit
for taking their punishment so well.</p>

<p>The following day we were relieved, and went
back into the support trenches, and finally
marched back to Noeux-les-Mines on 7th
November. On 17th November Major R. B. C.
Raban joined the Battalion as Second in Command.
Christmas and New Year were celebrated
at Allouagne, and here too was held a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span>
Divisional Boxing Exhibition, the principal
event being an exciting 10 rounds fight between
Private O'Rourke of the Camerons, and Sergt.
Macleod of the Seaforths, the latter winning.</p>

<p>On the 14th January, 1916, the Battalion
returned to the trenches, taking over section
14 bis on Hill 70. During this tour there was
attached to us "C" Company of the 6th Royal
Irish Regiment for instruction. Mining operations
had now started in earnest, and this
involved heavy trench mortar and shell fire,
causing numerous casualties. It was during
this tour of duty that we found and buried the
body of Lieut.-Colonel A. F. Douglas Hamilton,
V.C. He was lying just where he had been
killed, and, although it was remarkable that his
body had not been discovered before, yet it
was a source of satisfaction to all that he should
have finally been buried by the officers and men
of the Regiment in which he had served, and of
which he was so proud. On the 23rd March
"B" Company proceeded to Labuissiere for
duty at 1st Corps Headquarters. The Battalion
was to have been inspected by the Commander
of the 1st Corps on the 24th March,
but owing to snow it was cancelled. Next day
we railed to Lillers, and marched to billets in
Allouagne. On the 3rd April Major R. Raban
left, on being appointed to the Command of the
13th Royal Scots, and was therefore struck off
the strength.</p>

<p>On the 13th April Colonel Sandilands relinquished
the Command of the Battalion on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
being promoted Brigadier-General Commanding
the 104th Infantry Brigade. He was given a
great send off by the officers and men of the
Battalion, who lined the street of Allouagne in
his honour.</p>

<p>The following article, which was written by
Colonel Sandilands as a brief review of the
period during which he commanded the Battalion,
appeared in the April Number of <i>The
79th News</i>, 1916:&mdash;</p>

<div class="small">

 <p class="center">A YEAR'S COMMAND.</p>

 <p>It is now just a year since I took over command of the 7th
 Battalion, but in some ways it seems like ten years since I arrived at
 Chiseldon.</p>

 <p>Out of the 1000 men serving then, how many are there still
 with us in the trenches?</p>

 <p>Whatever officers and men there may be, must recall at times
the old days which we spent so happily together. The training on
the Downs, the long dusty march to Park House: these are now
things of the past.</p>

 <p>As we wade about in mud and water, it seems like a dream to
think of Tower Hill, where we used to lie amongst the trees, well
concealed from Generals, and eat our dinners from the cookers,
which in those days were strange machines of unknown habits.</p>

 <p>The Highland Brigade Championship; the Officers' Riding
School; the gramophone in the Canteen; the sixpenny novels; Officers
Mess garden, which never produced a blade of grass; finally, the
Sunday when we got our orders to go to France, the suppressed
excitement of the Channel crossing, our triumphant march through
Boulogne with pipes and drums in full swing&mdash;how many of us are
still alive who remember these days?</p>

 <p>It is amusing now to think of the difficulty we had in taking
over billets at Houle, and the deadly silence in which we marched
from Gonnehem, on the night when the regimental dog was lost,
with his tartan coat and regimental badges.</p>

 <p>How many men are still left from those who rushed out of the
houses at Brèbis to see the shells bursting, and who dug at Maroc
in the firm belief that they were exposed to untold dangers? What
letters used to be written home in those days to fond mothers, describing
the hardships, the terrific shell fire, and the groans of the
dying. No doubt these mothers were moved to tears at the thoughts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
of what their sons were suffering, little knowing of the peace and
quiet of the trenches at Maroc and Quality Street.</p>

 <p>But if the same mothers could have seen their sons in the
trenches at Hulluch in October, they would have good reason to
weep. Liquid mud up to one's knees; the parapets consisting of
half-buried Germans; a perfect hail of shells at intervals throughout
the day and night!</p>

 <p>In those days it took me three solid hours to drag myself through
the mud and water on my morning round of perhaps 2 miles. Officers
and men alike were caked with mud.</p>

 <p>What an afternoon that was when the parapet was blown in
and we lost 12 killed and 25 wounded in a few minutes! I shall
never forget seeing boys who might well have been still at school,
pinched with hunger and cold, sitting crouched under a waterproof
sheet, fumbling with their frozen fingers, trying to open a letter
from home. This letter was probably their one gleam of light in
their horrible surroundings; and yet they never complained, but
stuck to it like Camerons. I used to curse in my heart the loafers
at home who ought to have been out here, instead of leaving it to
lads who never should have been exposed to a winter in the trenches.</p>

 <p>Who is there left in the Battalion that used to come to the
garden at Verquin to listen to the drums and pipes playing Retreat,
in the days when we first began to know that we were to take part
in one of the greatest battles of the age?</p>

 <p>The little broken-down house, which was the Battalion Headquarters
at Philosophe the night before Loos, is still there. Quality
Street, instead of being a peaceful little village where one lived in
comparative safety, is now battered every day by German shells.</p>

 <p>How many men are there still in the ranks who clambered over
the parapet on the 25th, and joined in that mad rush which struck
terror into the Bavarian regiments who were up against us? I do
not suppose that in any case there can be many who have a clear
recollection of what actually did happen in the charge, or on that
fateful afternoon when the remnant of the 44th Brigade hung on to
Hill 70, silent and grim in their determination to hold the Hill for
Scotland. The bank behind which we first began to dig is still
there, and easily recognised, just between the firing and support
line.</p>

 <p>What a weary little party returned to Philosophe that night!
What a shambles Quality Street was next morning when we went
back through it to hold the old German line.</p>

 <p>Even Christmas at Allouagne, the concerts in the Recreation
Room, and the boxing in the Hospital yard, are beginning to fade
away in the distance.</p>

 <p>Although we have recently been lucky, yet there are many of
our comrades who marched off from Noeux-les-Mines in January,
but will never answer their names again at Roll Call. Some have
been buried at Loos, within a few yards of where we fought on the
25th, and some have been buried in the trenches.</p>

 <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>
 I often wonder whether the men of the Battalion realise the
link that is being formed amongst us. Do they realise, when the
war is over, the longing to see some of their old officers again will
be such as to defy description? Do they realise that little acts of
unselfishness and kindness, performed every day in the trenches,
will be amongst their most treasured remembrances, no matter
whether they go out into the world or return to a life of ease and
comfort? Then it may be that for the first time the old saying,
"Once a Cameron always a Cameron," will come home to them in
its full intensity.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 3.<br />
    HULLUCH LOOS SECTOR.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">On</span>
the 26th April the Battalion returned
to the trenches under the command of
Major T. L. Cunningham, relieving the 7th
Royal Sussex Regiment in the Quarry Sector.
By this time the mining operations had made
the front line into a series of craters, and the
shelling of the enemy had become increasingly
severe. The following day the R.E. blew up
the right leg of "Hairpin." We lost several
men in the bombardment which followed, the
usual practice after exploding a mine being that
the enemy would start firing trench mortars,
which would be replied to by our field guns,
the enemy in return firing his whizzbangs and
howitzers on our front line system. The 4th
of May saw 3 more mines exploded in the Hairpin
crater, after which our bombers advanced
to secure the lip of the crater. The enemy
counter-attacked, and a very severe fight took
place between our bombers and the enemy, in
which we finally drove him back to his original
position, while we held the crater. After the
attack the enemy gave our trenches a long and
severe bombardment, which caused many casualties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
The Battalion was relieved on the 11th May
by the 7th K.O.S.B.'s, and proceeded to La
Bourse in Divisional Reserve. Here the men
enjoyed good baths, the time being filled up
with odd parades and finding the inevitable
working parties for the front line of trenches.
On the 13th May Major C. H. Marsh, D.S.O.,
of the 18th Lancers, who had lately commanded
the 7th K.O.S.B.'s, took over command of the
Battalion from Major Cunningham, who had
been in command since the departure of Brigadier-General
Sandilands.</p>

<div class="image-center">
  <img width="404" height="600" alt="" src="images/sandilands.jpg" />
  <div class="caption">
   <p>Colonel <span class="smcap">J. W. Sandilands</span>, C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O.,</p>
   <p>commanded from 22nd April, 1915, to 13th April, 1916.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>On the 14th May the Battalion was put under
the orders of the 46th Brigade, and on the
19th relieved the A. and S. H. in the left sub-sector
of the "Hohenzollern." Mining operations
were still in full swing, the enemy exploding a
mine near "Argyll Sap," which filled in the "Hogs
Back" and part of "Northumberland Trench."
It was a complete surprise, and many men were
buried and injured by the falling debris, "C"
Company suffering the worst, there being 3
killed and 45 wounded. The Battalion was
to have been relieved that night, but the relief
had to be postponed in order that the saps and
trenches might be cleared before handing over.
About the 22nd May everyone began to expect
a Boche attack, as the Intelligence Reports
constantly contained references to large enemy
working-parties and abnormal transport movements.
In one instance as many as 5,000 men
were reported as being seen moving in our
direction. Two prisoners were also taken, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">{41}</a></span>
confirmed the report that the enemy intended
attacking and using gas. Apparently our
counter-action proved effective, as no attack
ever took place.</p>

<p>On the 28th June, in the right sub-sector of
the "Hohenzollern," 4 patrols from "C" and
"D" Companies, under the commands of
Second-Lieuts. Drew, Goudie, Currie and
M'Crostie, attempted to raid the enemy's lines
after a discharge of gas. Three of the patrols
found the wire uncut and the trench strongly
held by the enemy. "A Bangalore Torpedo,"
which was to be used to cut the wire, was unfortunately
hit in the trench, and, exploding
as the raiders were getting into position, killed
the men who were carrying it. The fourth
patrol, however, under Lieut. Goudie, succeeded
in reaching the enemy's front line. This they
bombed, and then returned to our own lines.
One of the patrol being killed, Lieut. Goudie,
Sergeant Small, and Private Heely tried to
bring back the body, but had to abandon the
attempt owing to the enemy's heavy machine
gun fire. The total casualties were 9 men
killed and 19 other casualties.</p>

<p>On the 18th July our Engineers blew up
"Border Redoubt" at the junctions of "Riflemen's
Alley" and "Alexandria Trench." Instructions
had been given that after the explosion
the far lip of the crater was to be
consolidated. This proved a difficult job, but
we were ordered to persevere with it. The
explosion formed two craters, which were heavily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span>
bombarded with rifle grenades and aerial darts
by the enemy, who evidently had no intention
of trying to consolidate the crater himself.
Three different attempts were made to get into
the further crater, and within a few seconds, on
each occasion, every man was a casualty, as
the whole movement was under observation of
the enemy. However, after many hours arduous
work, lying flat on the stomach and scraping
with an entrenching tool, a trench of sorts
sufficient to hold the far lip of the crater was
formed. The work was arduous and trying,
as well as dangerous, but the officers and men
stuck to it bravely. The following afternoon
a Staff Officer came up with beautifully drawn
plans for consolidating the near lip of the craters,
a scheme which, if originally carried out, would
have saved many lives.</p>

</table>

<p>Amongst the wounded was Major Cunningham,
who had been with the Battalion since
it came to France in 1915, and who had commanded
the Battalion from the time General
Sandilands left until Colonel Marsh was appointed.
He was a good officer, a fearless man,
and liked by all.</p>

<p>On 22nd July the Battalion was relieved by
the Royal Berkshire Regiment, and proceeded
to Houchin. It was not realised at the time
that we were leaving this area for good, but as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">{43}</a></span>
it turned out we were not to return again to
Hulluch-Loos sector until practically the end of
the war. The men were glad to get away from
a sector where all the worst modern appliances
of war were used in abundance. Here they had
spent their first winter, and fought their first
great battle, and the names of Hulluch Alley,
Gordon Alley, etc., will be imprinted in their
memories for many a day. These long communication
trenches were nearly always half-full
of muddy water, but, luckily, as we were
wearing kilts, it was an easy matter to either
lift them up or to take them off, hang them
round the shoulders, and by this means arrive
comparatively dry in the front line, which was
not the fate of the trousered Battalions. When
going into the line these Battalions were soaking
wet before they arrived there, and if coming
out, not only arrived wet at their billets, but
had to carry all the extra weight of the mud,
etc., which had saturated into their puttees and
trousers&mdash;a thing that told considerably on tired
troops marching for several miles.</p>

<p>It was certainly a very trying sector. There
was never a tour without several casualties
from mines, "Flying Pigs," and, especially, aerial
darts, which infernal machines, many were
convinced, were covered with a poisonous paint.
We shall hazard no opinion on this point, but
it is curious to note that many a man who only
received the slightest wounds from them died
from the effects. The work was exceedingly
hard, as the trenches were constantly being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">{44}</a></span>
blown in or filled up with debris of mines and
explosives. Working parties had to be found
to repair this damage, as well as to carry the
spoil out of the mines. Mine carrying parties
were detailed in 8-hours shifts, every man
working one shift in 24 hours. The work consisted
of going down the mine shaft and carrying
up bags of spoil which were then emptied.
The carrying of lumps of chalk in the sand-bags
up the stairs became not only sore on the back,
but exceedingly wearisome to the legs. In
addition to this the same men had to be used for
trench repairs, carrying parties for trench stores,
rations, etc., so that it can be easily understood
that there was little time for sleep or rest.</p>

<p>In spite of all this, many men were sorry to
leave the district where they had made a number
of good friends among the mining villagers in
their billets. Especially did they enjoy a rest
in Bethune, where some of the attractions of
the town could be indulged in. They would
sooner have taken the risks and hard work of
this area, and get back to billets which were
occupied by women and children, than have
enjoyed the safeness of some of the quieter
areas where life was much more monotonous.</p>

<p>One has often heard grumbles at the French
peasant for such things as making a charge for
the use of buckets to draw water with. But
when one learned the number of buckets which
were lost a certain sympathy grew towards the
owner. It was surprising how domesticated
most of the men became, helping in the houses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">{45}</a></span>
and playing with the children, for Jock is a
kind-hearted fellow.</p>

<p>The possibilities for bathing in this area were
also good. Many of the large coal mines had a
splendid system of baths at the minehead.
The French miner keeps his clothes at the mine,
and when he has done his day's work there
is a good spray bath heated by the exhaust
steam waiting for him. After that he puts on
his ordinary clothes, leaving his working clothes
to be dried for the next day. There were also
large wooden towers used for cooling and condensing
purposes, the water dropping from the
top into a tank 40 or 50 feet long and about
6 feet deep. These made splendid bathing
ponds, where the men were able to enjoy a swim,
even when the weather was inclined to be cold,
as the water was always more or less warm.</p>

<p>"Hutments," such as existed towards the
end of the war, had not yet come into use, so
that men were billeted in houses and farms,
some occupied and some not. There were few
sadder sights, or one which brought home the
horrors of war, than some of those deserted
mining villages. The once pretty little gardens
now buried under the bricks, mortar, and
beams of the shattered houses, through which
an odd flower would force its way, the roses still
clinging to the broken garden railings. Inside
the house was strewn with women's clothing,
children's toys, perambulators, etc., pointing
out how hurriedly the once happy home
had been sacrificed in order to escape the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">{46}</a></span>
enemy's shells, or even greater cruelties, for the
Hun was no respecter of women or children.
What anguish of heart these poor women must
have suffered. Hay lofts made good billets, but
trouble lay for the unwary, as there was no
floor, the hay being supported on the top of
beams. If the layer of hay was thin through
you went. A stout sergeant, while taking roll
call one night, thus suddenly disappeared.
Luckily his fall was broken by landing on the
back of a cow sleeping below, much to its surprise
and annoyance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 4.<br />
    THE SOMME BATTLE, 1916.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">We</span>
now received definite orders that we
were to leave the area and to move in a
southerly direction. We were not told
where we were going, but as we knew the Battle
of the Somme had started, it was not difficult
to guess. The only point which might have
raised any doubt in our minds was the fact
that the men had been worked almost to a
standstill in the sector which we were leaving,
and they had been encouraged to do so by
being informed on more than one occasion by
the Higher Command that this activity was
the part they were called upon to play in order
to assist in the great attack which was going on
further south. However, we had all become
old soldiers by this time, and therefore quite
expected to learn that, in spite of such promises,
it had become necessary to employ us in the
battle line, and we set off cheerfully southwards
with the full intention of once more proving
to the Boches what we could do in the lighting
line. In fact, many would have been sorry, in
their hearts, had a big battle taken place without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span>
our Battalion having a hand in it. It would
have been looked upon as a reflection on the
Battalion that a big fight could possibly be
carried through without our aid!</p>

<p>We started this march on the 23rd July, and
proceeded to Dievel, where we had two days'
rest. From there we continued the march
through Gouy, Occoches, Autheux, Maours,
Mirvaux and Lahoussoue, arriving near Albert
on the 8th August. This march was one of the
most enjoyable periods which the Battalion
spent in France. The weather was extremely
hot, and the marching was done in the early
morning, generally starting an hour or so before
dawn, and completing the march by 9 or 10 a.m.
This saved us trudging along in the burning
heat, and also allowed the men the remainder
of the day for rest or amusement. The route
was well behind the line, through villages which
had not been destroyed. As a rule we were
not billeted in the houses, but bivouaced in
fields, if possible beside a river, where the men
were able to bathe and play games. It was
noticeable how physique and spirits improved
as the march went on, and by the time we
reached Albert we were all on the top of our
form.</p>

<p>At Albert we once more bivouaced in a field
on the south side of the main road, about one
mile west of the town. By this time we were
quite experienced at making shelters out of all
kinds of odds and ends. When at Albert we
adopted the plan of wearing the smoke-helmet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span>
as a sporran. This was not only a very convenient
way of carrying it behind the lines,
but when the satchel was properly washed it
also looked very smart. It was soon possible
to realise the severity of the fighting, as there
was abundant evidence of the action which had
taken place over the area. There was hardly
a square yard of ground that was not ploughed
up by shell, the whole area being composed of
holes of different sizes. On the 17th we moved
forward. As we marched through Albert we
saw that wonderful sight of the statue of the
Virgin and Child which had been on the top
of the cathedral tower originally, but, having
been hit by a shell, now stood out at right
angles overlooking the square. The Child, held
out at arms length over the head of the blessed
Virgin, appeared to be gazing at and invoking
a blessing on the troops passing below. We
were now to take the switch-line, which formed
part of the German system of trenches in front
of Contalmaison. We had previously prepared
our jumping-off trenches, which we left
at 8.55 a.m., following strong artillery barrage.
The German front-line was taken without much
difficulty, many of the enemy surrendering.
We reached our objective and started digging
in, but the enemy developed a bombing attack
from a trench on our right, and Captain MacRae,
along with Lieut. Orr, started counter-bombing.
Our supply of bombs began to give out, but
happily there were large numbers of German
bombs lying about, and with these we were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
able to do good execution, especially as we
found that we could get a longer range with
these than with our own. Luckily, when we
were getting short handed from casualties, we
were able to get the assistance of two platoons
of the 9th Gordons to carry bombs from the
rear up to our bombers.</p>

<p>In the meantime it was apparent that, owing
to casualties, we were not sufficiently strong
to hold the elbow and force the trench where
the Germans had formed a block. Unfortunately,
the Stokes Gun Team had been put
out of action. Lieut. Anderson, who was in
charge of the guns, did magnificent work for a
time, feeding and firing the guns himself while
the team were sent away to fetch more ammunition.
Our casualties had now been severe, and
it was evidently necessary to form a further
attack to clear the remainder of the trenches
if we were to maintain the ground already won.
This was organised with the assistance of a
party of the Seaforth Highlanders who had
arrived as a carrying party. About this time
it was noticed that the Germans were massing
near the Martinpuich-Pozieres road, but our
artillery soon brought their fire on to them
and broke them up. Our counter-attack was
launched at 5.50 p.m., and was entirely successful.</p>

<p>Our casualties were heavy, 5 officers being
killed and 9 wounded, while among the rank
and file 44 were killed, 16 were missing believed
killed, and 167 wounded. For this action we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
received several congratulations, that from the
G.O.C. 4th Army stating:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent nodent">"Please convey the Army Commander's congratulations to
the 15th and 1st Divisions on their successes and the enterprise
they are displaying, which is invaluable at this stage of the
battle."</p>

<p>We carried on in this area up till the 19th
September, when we were relieved by the 8th
Yorks of the 23rd Division, and went back into
Divisional reserve at Framvillers.</p>

<p>Here we remained carrying out training
until the 5th October, when we once more
marched up and bivouaced at Beaucourt, going
into the front line on the 11th, which by this
time had been advanced as far as Le Sars.
On the 13th October the Regimental Sergeant-Major,
A. K. Scott, D.C.M., was killed. He
had joined the Battalion early in 1914, and
had been with it ever since. He was an exceptionally
good R.S.M., a strict disciplinarian,
handling those under him with tact, a splendid
organiser for whom no amount of work seemed
too much. A brave man and a born soldier,
he was respected and beloved by all who came
in contact with him. The weather now was
broken and the ground was becoming a quagmire,
owing to the innumerable shell-holes
being full of water. Our front line consisted of
a series of these shell-holes, which made all
movements by day impossible, and at night,
owing to the lack of any sort of landmarks, it
was the simplest thing possible to lose one's
way. The reserve positions were at Contal-maison.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
It was a long weary march from the
front line back to this point, threading one's
way in the dark between the shell-holes. Afterwards
there was a duckboard track, but as it
was well known to the enemy it was often
shelled. It was especially hard upon Lewis
Gun Teams and Bombers, who had to carry
their supplies of drums and ammunition and
bags of bombs. We tried once or twice leaving
our ammunition and taking over the relieving
Battalion's so as to save carrying, but the men
always complained that the ammunition, etc.,
handed over to them was dirty, and they would
prefer to stick to their own.</p>

<p>It was exhausting enough walking through
the mud in ordinary kit, but the physical
exertion became almost unendurable at the end
of two or three hours when a man, in addition
to his rifle and 120 rounds, had to carry a
heavy load which caused him to sink deep in the
mud at every step. One was filled with
admiration at the pluck and endurance of the
young lads who did it.</p>

<p>It was intended that we should carry out
another attack, but, although the Battalion
moved twice up to the line for this purpose, on
each occasion it had to be postponed, as the
weather had rendered the ground impassable.
Jumping-off trenches, however, were prepared.
On one occasion, when the attack looked
imminent, the Battalion was brought back into
the line, the Brigadier stating that the parties
who had been put on to the work had not been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">{53}</a></span>
able to make much progress, and that he felt
sure that if we took it on it would be completed.
This nice compliment compensated us for being
brought back into the line before our time,
and spurred on the men to finish the task&mdash;which
they did.</p>

<p>On the 4th November we once more went
into Divisional Reserve at Bresle. Here we
took over a camp which had been kept in
splendid order. Even the tent boards had been
thoroughly scrubbed by those before us, which
created in our minds a very favourable impression
of the outgoing Battalion. The camp
stood on high ground outside the village. We
were given the choice of being billeted in the
village or occupying the camp, but the advantages
of all being together in a clean place
more than compensated for not going into
billets which at the best appeared very dirty.
The cold, however, was intense, the water being
frozen solid inside the tent every morning.
The officers rather envied the men sleeping in a
crowded tent, as they had a better chance of
being warm. So far, unfortunately, we had
only been able to get one blanket per man.
The cold did not, however, affect the men's
health. The way in which health improved
even in the trenches when the frost came
was remarkable. No doubt it must have
saved the spreading of infection, as in the line
there were still a great many dead lying unburied,
and every shell-hole was full of stagnant
water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
We carried out a varied programme of
training, being lucky enough to have a rifle-range
close at hand. By this time the Army
was once more realising the advantages of the
rifle, which had for some time been sadly neglected
in favour of the bomb, an instrument
which is exceedingly useful in trench warfare
where the sap-heads and trenches are a few
yards from each other, but perfectly useless
in more or less open warfare. The average
man could not throw a bomb more than 20/30
yards, and at that range it was almost as dangerous
to the thrower as to the enemy. It was
extraordinary, however, what a hold it got
of the troops, a large part of even the home
training evidently being devoted to it. Our
main object now was to make the men realise
that their best friend was their rifle. There
is a story told of one instance where a man was
seen chasing a Boche within 30/40 yards of
him in order to try and get within easy bombing
distance! It apparently never struck him that
with his rifle the Boche was a certain target at
this distance.</p>

<p>We also had good ground at Bresle for practice
in the construction of strong points. At this
time plenty of amusement could always be got
by visiting the officer's riding school, carried
on from 7 to 8 in the morning. The whole day,
however, was not devoted merely to instructional
training, part of every afternoon being
devoted to sports, especially football. Even
in the hottest weather or after a long march
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">{55}</a></span>
the men would hardly be in their billets before
somebody had the football out.</p>

<p>The Brigade Games were held here, and
everyone went in for all sorts of training with
the object of trying to win the Championship.
The sports were held in the field below our
camp on the 21st November, the Championship
events being the 100 yards, the mile, the cross
country race, the long and high jumps, the
tug-of-war, putting the weight, tossing the
caber, and football. The points scored were:&mdash;</p>

<table class="casualties" summary="">

<tr>
 <td>Gordons,</td>
 <td class="count">14</td>
</tr>

<tr>
 <td>Black Watch,</td>
 <td class="count">14</td>
</tr>

<tr>
 <td>Seaforths,</td>
 <td class="count">23</td>
</tr>

<tr>
 <td>Camerons,</td>
 <td class="count">25</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>So that we, for the third time, won the silver
bugle, as the Champions of the Brigade. The tug-of-war
was a most tremendous affair, the final
of which was an all over pull, lasting about 25
minutes. The Camerons' team in the first
period of the pull were over with the exception
of three men, but by degrees they slowly
recovered themselves, and finally, by a sort
of cross between a war dance and a quick march,
they pulled the other team over the line.
The excitement was intense! The training for
this event was very amusing. On both sides
the trainers were old soldiers who had competed
with each other many times before in India
and elsewhere. If either Sergt.-Major while
training his team saw the other approaching,
it did not matter how far off, the training
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">{56}</a></span>
would promptly cease, as they were certain
that the opponent was out to gain tips! Sergt.-Major
Vass was responsible for the splendid
training of the winning Cameron team.</p>

<p>While at Bresle we had the honour of being
inspected by the G.O.C. in C., Field Marshal
Sir Douglas Haig. He complimented us highly
on the part we had taken in the Battle of the
Somme, and expressed himself as greatly
pleased with the appearance of the Battalion.</p>

<p>On the 1st December we moved back once
more into Albert, via Laviville and Millencourt,
preparatory to going into the line. While
behind the line we had a strenuous time cleaning
and repairing the roads. The Corps Commander
issued a special Order, stating that
"He wished to place on record his great appreciation
of the work done by the troops on the
roads, railways, and tramlines during our last
six weeks in the Corps area, and that with the
adverse conditions he fully realised the great
amount of extra work which it involved, but
trusted that all ranks would realise how essential
the work was in view of future operations,
and, further, for their own welfare."</p>

<p>Moving into "Scots Redoubt," on the 16th, we
once more took up our duty in the front line.
By this time trench feet began to appear&mdash;a
trouble which always existed during the mud,
cold and wet of winter. It was a satisfaction
to know, however, that the Highland Brigade
suffered less in this respect than any other
brigade in the Division, the possible reason being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">{57}</a></span>
the wearing of hose tops instead of puttees.
When the puttee gets wet it is very apt to shrink
and press upon the leg, interfering with the
circulation. The Highlanders, however, were
able to wear two pairs of hose tops, thereby
keeping the men's legs warm without interfering
with the circulation, by pressing the feet
into boots when wearing two pairs of socks.
They acted the same way as mittens do
for the hands. It is pleasing to realise that
the Highland garb once more proved of value
as a fighting kit. In order to prevent trench
feet all men had to rub their feet and legs with
whale oil. This order had to be carried out
most strictly, fault always being found if it
was not done.</p>

<p>On one occasion, when some men were in the
outpost line for 12 hours&mdash;which consisted of
a small shell-hole full of water&mdash;one of them
developed trench feet on his return. Fault
was found because he had gone 12 hours without
oiling his feet, even although he had done so
immediately before going on and coming off
duty. On it being pointed out that it was
impossible for a man to go through this performance
while standing in water in an exposed
shell-hole, the reply came back that there was
no reason why he should not stand on one foot,
lift the other out of the water, oil it and put
it back again! A performance which no doubt
seemed simple to those behind the lines, but
was not so easily carried out in practice. Another
point which was insisted on was trying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
to get the men to put on dry socks. Of course
it was quite impossible to dry the socks in the
line, but some genius behind the lines was struck
with the brilliant idea that the men should
carry a sock in each trouser pocket, which would
be an effective way of drying them. This order
was circulated around the whole of the Highland
Brigade, without anybody realising the
difficulty that a man in the kilt would have in
finding his trouser pockets!</p>

<p>No movement could take place near the
outpost lines in daylight, which necessitated
the C.O. and others, if they wished to see the
outpost and forward lines, making a tour just
before sunrise. Hardly was there a day that
the Brigadier and his staff did not go round
these posts, no matter whether they were deep
in mud or snow. There being no continuous
line of trenches, it was the simplest thing to
lose one's way. One morning an officer who
had just relieved one of the posts, bringing with
him the rum ration, set out to walk over to the
next post in order to give them their ration.
It was a foggy morning with snow on the ground,
and, unfortunately, he missed the post and
wandered on into the German lines, the Battalion
thereby losing a very capable officer and
also the rum ration, which from the men in the
post's point of view, was possibly the more
serious. The enemy, however, were apt to do
the same, and on more than one occasion we
got German prisoners who had wandered from
their own line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">{59}</a></span>
We were unfortunate enough to have to spend
Christmas in the front line, but were relieved
on Christmas night, and moved back to Shelter
Wood. It was quite impossible to hold our
Christmas and New Year dinner there, as the
camps were hardly more comfortable than the
front line. The mud was indescribable, and
it was with the greatest difficulty that ordinary
rations could be got. Thanks to the sea of mud,
it was not possible to distinguish between the
points where the road was solid and where there
was a shell hole. It was no uncommon sight
to see a mule team up to their necks in water.
Sometimes it even necessitated the wretched
animals being destroyed. One of the senior
officers took it upon himself to try and cope
with the mud in the camp, and was promptly
appointed "O.C. Mud!" His system was to
cut trenches into which the mud was pushed
by means of a kind of shovel, then everybody
stood along the trench armed with more of these
shovels and kept the mud on the move till it
reached the edge of the camp. The idea was
good, but unfortunately mud seemed to be
created as quickly as it was removed, and for
those moving about at night these trenches
with their slimy contents were regular traps.</p>

<p>In consequence of the difficulties of transport
all stores were very short, especially coal.
One had, therefore, to resort to all kinds of means
in order to get fuel. Luckily, what once had
been beautiful woods were situated near the
camp, but now all the trees were smashed and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
torn up by artillery. There were strict orders,
however, that no wood should be cut without
permission being received from the French
Woods and Forests Department, Paris. The
acting C.O. used, therefore, to sally forth into
the wood with a party of men to collect fuel,
much to the fear of the Adjutant, who always
expected to see him arrested for doing so. He,
however, calmed his conscience (if that was
necessary) by only removing the fallen timber.</p>

<p>It was our fate to spend Hogmanay of this
year once again in the front line. It was generally
expected that the Boches would do something
to celebrate the occasion, but luckily
our prophecies proved wrong.</p>

<p>We could look back on the old year 1916,
with pride. We had done a lot of hard work
and strenuous fighting. In spite of heavy
casualties, the Battalion was as keen and efficient
as ever. Our successes had added to our
<i>esprit de corps</i>. We were no longer a new
Battalion without a history. We could now
draw inspiration from the feats of arms we had
ourselves accomplished, as well as from that of
the old Regiment to which we were all so proud
to belong.</p>

<p>Sometimes one wonders if the ardour of the
work, apart from its discomfort and danger, is
fully realised by those who never experienced
it. How often has one heard those at home
remark: "Oh, yes, while you fellows are
fighting, we are doing our bit at home&mdash;we
have curtailed our holidays, and we don't get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span>
away from our work till 6 and 7 at night."
Even Staff Officers would impress on you the
long hours they worked, and without doubt
most of them did work hard: an officer at
G.H.Q. would be in his office by 9 a.m., and,
with the exception of meal hours and an hour
for necessary exercise, he would not leave his
duties till after 10 p.m. While all this is admitted,
yet it would be wrong to imagine that
the Regimental Officer did not also have long
hours. Moreover, when his work was done he
had no comfortable bed in which to rest. Even
to take one's clothes off was looked upon as a
luxury. It might be of interest, therefore, to
put on record an ordinary day's work of a
Company Commander in the line.</p>

<p>During the day he was kept busy with inspecting
his line, visits from Staff Officer,
making up returns, answering correspondence,
organising night working parties, indenting for
material, and the many other matters of the
daily routine. At night again, when the
rations came up, the C.Q.M.S. would arrive
for instructions regarding pay, rations, detailing
of men for leave, courses, etc. After
that he had working parties to visit, sentries
to be inspected, examining localities which
could not be visited in daylight, officers coming
from patrols to interview, prepare and write
out patrol and other reports which had to be at
Brigade Headquarters before 6 a.m. These
are some of the duties which occupied him
during the night. From this it can be realised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">{62}</a></span>
that the officer in the line generally got two or
three hours sleep at odd intervals during the
night, and with luck another two hours
during the day. And remember that he had
to sleep often in a damp shelter or draughty
dug-out in his wet clothes without even a
valise to lie on, many a time with not so
much as a blanket to roll round him. When
behind the line in "rest billets" he was
more comfortable, as he would have his "flea-bag"
on the floor of a Nissen hut, but still he
was hard worked. His day was occupied with
training, clothing, etc., and his evening with
preparing training programmes and the many
other details of running a Company. There
were also night working parties of which he
would have to take his turn every third or
fourth night, when he would be up until 3 or 4 in
the morning. From this the civilian who thinks
he was hard worked by doing eight hours a day
without any days off (on big pay) can realise
that the soldier was doing as much, if not more,
with all the discomforts and risks over and
above.</p>

<p>On the 18th January Lieut.-Colonel D. E.
M. M. Crichton took over command of the
Battalion, Colonel Marsh having gone down the
line sick. We were all sorry to part with
Colonel Marsh, who was a good soldier, and who
had been with us through all the fighting in the
Somme. He was suffering from fever, the
result of many years service in India, and
which had been aggravated by the exposure of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">{63}</a></span>
wintering in the Somme. Life under the best
circumstances was most miserable, but to have
all the depression of fever on the top of it must
have been exceedingly trying, although many of
us at the time did not know what he had to
endure.</p>

<p>One of our experiences about this time was a
dug-out fire, some brilliant genius putting a
brazier on the top of a box of Verey-lights,
which after a time went off and started shooting
about the dug-out. The dug-out was situated
in the front line in the Le Sars sunken road,
which was generally a sea of mud, often overflowing
down into the dug-out. One would
have thought that it was impossible for any of
the timber saturated with mud and water to
burn. This soon proved to be wrong, as the
fire worked its way up one of the stairs, getting
a splendid down-draught from the others. The
place was soon a roaring furnace. The officers
and men set about building up a barricade with
sandbags. This was an exciting experience,
for the Verey-lights kept shooting about as the
fire increased in intensity, and might at any
moment have set fire to the boxes of bombs,
etc. One of the men actually ordered an
officer out with the remark, "it was no place
for him," when he began to realise the danger.
Perhaps this was not strictly in accordance
with the idea of army discipline, but at any rate
it shewed the good spirit and affection that
existed between the officers and men.</p>

<p>At the beginning of February we were relieved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">{64}</a></span>
by the 5th Australian Brigade, the 18th
Australian Battalion relieving the Camerons.
We went back through Becourt to Contay,
where we went into corps reserve, nominally
for a rest, but practically for intensive training.
In this little village we at last got the opportunity
of holding our long-delayed Christmas
and New Year dinner, which took place by
Companies. The 2nd in Command and the
Padre proceeded to Amiens to purchase provisions
for the revels&mdash;pigs, wine, beer, etc.
The first had to be bought alive in the Pig
Market, where acquaintance was struck up
with the most villainous looking Frenchman.
The porkers were chosen from the fat ones
that squealed the loudest when poked in the
ribs by the Padre's stick. The dinners were
a great success. The Parish Priest was a guest
at the Officer's dinner, and appeared to be a
good judge of wine, and thoroughly to enjoy
his meal, besides being a very jolly old gentleman.</p>

<hr />

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">{65}</a></span></div>

<h2>CHAPTER 5.<br />
    BATTLE OF ARRAS, 1917.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Our</span>
rest was not for long, however, as
we started once more to move north
on the 15th February, leaving the
Somme area for good. All will look back
upon the Somme as a sort of horrible nightmare
of mud and water, of scarcity of fresh meat
rations, fuel, etc., of long and weary marches
up to Le Sars and back again to the camps
in "Scots Redoubt" and Metz Wood, where
the conditions were almost as bad as in the front
line. Not a place where the men could be
entertained, not a Y.M.C.A. or other hut within
miles of the front line, not a civilian to be seen.
The Lewis Gunners had a specially hard time
of it pulling their hand carts through the
mud and shell-holes. The design was selected
at home, doubtless with great care, but
they must have been tested on the Guards'
Parade or other sound ground. For the work
in hand it would be difficult to imagine a worse
pattern than that of these carts with their thin
iron wheels set close in to the side of the cart
and without any guiding pole or shafts.
Luckily they were soon abandoned. The cold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span>
in the line during the winter was intense. Owing
to the muddy conditions the men could not
take their great coats with them, but they
were now so hardy that this exposure did not
affect their health.</p>

<p>Now and then an officer was able to "lorry
jump" back to Amiens, and spend the evening
round Charlie's Bar, or dine at a most excellent
restaurant, where the dinners and wines were
good and the waitresses pleasing to look upon.
In fact, the sight of a woman, however ugly,
was a delight. We fitted up at Albert a house
which acted as a kind of rest billet for those
suffering from slight ailments. The Town
Major was always threatening to turn us out,
but we contrived to keep sufficiently in his
favour to prevent this catastrophe. We
managed to fit up a long passage as a drying
room, with the assistance of some water pipes
which the R.E.'s kindly dumped in the square
in front of the house, and which we quietly
appropriated during the night. This house
proved of the greatest value, as the temporarily
sick were employed in washing socks and hose tops,
which were dried in this room, so that
every night we were able to send up a supply
of dry socks, etc., to the men in the line in
exchange for their dirty wet ones. No doubt
this rest had an excellent effect on the men's
health, and saved many from having to go to
hospital.</p>

<p>The transport were generally in lines about
La Boiselle Crater. Sometimes those in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">{67}</a></span>
front line imagined that the transport had a
"cushy" time. But one is rather apt to think
that the "other man" has the best of a bargain.
No doubt they did not suffer the casualties
of front-line troops, but their hours were long
and weary. By night they struggled up with
the rations, etc., often through shell fire, their
carts up to the axles in mud, and the mules
sometimes being nearly drowned by falling
into shell-holes, out of which it was a long and
weary business to extricate them. During the
day they had to clean and feed their animals
and collect the rations from the "train." They
thus were working practically night and day,
in all weathers and during all hours. It was
wonderful how the men and animals were able
to carry on.</p>

<p>We left Contay with regret. This was the
first place where we had seen any sort of civilian
life for months; and we had just settled down
and begun to make friends with the inhabitants
when we had to move on. The Mayor came
and expressed his regret that we were going
away, and told us that the inhabitants had
greatly appreciated the good conduct and kindness
of the men. We marched to Moucheaux,
via Beauval, Gazaincourt, Bouquemaison and
Crosiette. Here we settled down once more
to train, as we learned that we were to take
part in a big attack. This attack was delayed,
as it could not take place until the new railway
line from Doullens to Arras was completed.
We soon received orders that practically the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">{68}</a></span>
whole of the Battalion was to move to Milly
under Major Macleod, to form a working-party
on the railway cutting there. The men
thoroughly enjoyed this change of employment,
which consisted of three shifts of eight hours
each per 24 hours, digging at the cutting.
There is nothing a soldier appreciates more than
to know the number of hours he will be employed
and how long he is going to get to himself.
He hates being messed about. There was also
an element of competition in the work, as the
total earth excavated by each shift was duly
recorded, and the rivalry between Battalions
and "shifts" to reach highest out-put was
very keen.</p>

<p>At first we had great difficulty with our
rations. By some mistake no arrangements
had been made for these. The D.A.Q.M.G.,
when appealed to, said he would indent for us,
but that according to the regulations they
could not be supplied for 3 days. After the
Major had ridden round the country for some
hours he found a Railhead Officer, who, realising
the situation, and not being quite hidebound
to the Regulations, gave us some tins of
bully beef and biscuits. Next day the hunt
commenced again, and finally Corps H.Q. put
the matter right. Theoretically, there is no
difference between rations of Corps and other
troops, but there is no doubt we never got
rations anything like those we received when
acting as Corps troops.</p>

<p>On 24th February, 1917, the Battalion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
Headquarters moved to Maizeres, the working
party returning from Milly on 2nd March. On
the 6th, the Brigade was inspected by the
Commander-in-Chief at Ambrine. The Brigade
was drawn up in quarter column in fighting
dress. The Commander-in-Chief expressed
himself highly pleased with the appearance
and steadiness of the Brigade, and gave directions
that this should be communicated to all
ranks.</p>

<p>On the 11th March the 44th Brigade relieved
the 45th Brigade in support in Arras, the route
being by Penin, Tilloy, Hermaville, St. Pol-Arras
Road. The sheer destruction of the
Boche was very apparent. Before the war
the great straight roads had been lined with
splendid trees. These for miles he had cut down
and left on the road side. Even the fruit trees,
for which this district was famous, had all been
ruthlessly destroyed. As the Battalion got
near Arras the roads became very congested
with traffic, and the men had to move off the
highway or dodge between traffic in order to
get on. By the time we passed under the
Baudimont Gate the hour when the troops
were allowed out of billets had arrived. The
streets were absolutely packed with men and
vehicles. Although Arras was practically in
the front line the inhabitants remained in their
shops, and though shutters were up and no
lights could be shown a brisk trade was still
carried on inside the shops. One of the peculiar
things was that the Boche seldom shelled the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">{70}</a></span>
town after daylight. If he had done so he
would certainly have caused heavy casualties,
and as he must have heard the roar of heavy
traffic, it is difficult to understand why he did
not take this opportunity of doing serious
damage.</p>

<p>Our first experience in the line at Arras was
in the cemetery defences, a somewhat gruesome
place, and subject to the usual attentions of the
Boches to such a place. One man went to
hospital with what seemed to be a small piece
of shell in his cheek, but when the M.O.
extracted it, it was discovered to be a tooth,
apparently belonging to one of the rightful
inhabitants! Good shelter was to be had inside
some of the tombs.</p>

<p>On 18th March "D" Company carried out
a raid on the enemy's lines. The zero hour
was 2.50 a.m., and Captain W. D. Stuart was
in command, along with Lieut. Semple and
Lieut. Morton. The 9th and 12th Division
co-operated by similar raids on their fronts.
The object of the raid was to destroy enemy
dug-outs, and to obtain identifications and information
regarding the enemy's lines.</p>

<p>The raiding party took up position along
tapes which had been previously laid out by
Captain Stuart. The raiders advanced in two
parties (each two platoons) through separate
gaps in the enemy's wire. They met with no
difficulty in forming up, although an enemy
party of about 40 strong had been seen working
in front of their wire shortly before. An enemy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span>
machine gun kept firing through the gaps in
the wire, but this was luckily put out of action
by a direct hit from a shell. Both parties succeeded
in getting through the wire and entering
the enemy's trenches without encountering the
enemy. The fire trench was found to be badly
damaged, and the control trench, a few yards
in the rear, was discovered to be very wide and
deep (about 10 feet). The party working to
the north came across six dug-outs. Voices
were heard in them all. Each dug-out was
bombed by means of Stoke shells. Wire frames
acting as blocks had been erected in both the
fire and communication trenches, and these
made movement along the trenches difficult.
In most cases the parties had to climb out of
the trenches and go round the top.</p>

<p>The party working south found ten dug-outs;
two entrances had been blown in by the artillery
bombardment, the remainder were destroyed
with Stoke shells. No dead were found in the
trenches, but all dug-outs were still occupied
by the enemy. A machine gun in an emplacement
was destroyed. No gas cylinders were
seen nor identifications obtained. A party of
30 or 40 Boches were seen and fired at as they
retired through our box barrage. This was
thought to be the wiring party which had been
seen earlier in the evening. One of the dug-outs
which we destroyed caught fire. The
majority of the party returned to our trenches
at 3.25 a.m., though one officer and a Lewis
gunner, who were carrying a wounded man, did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">{72}</a></span>
not return till later. The enemy barrage did
not come down till 3 a.m., when the support
line&mdash;Islington Street&mdash;and the cemetery were
heavily shelled. The enemy put up the usual
number of lights, those well behind the line
bursting into golden rain. Our casualties
amounted to 1 killed, 1 missing believed to be
killed, and 35 wounded. Two died of wounds.</p>

<p>The following special orders were issued:&mdash;</p>

 <p class="indent nodent">"The G.O.C. 15th Division wishes to convey his appreciation
 to all ranks who took part in this morning's raid, and his congratulations
 on the success achieved.</p>

 <p class="indent">"The Corps Commander wishes to congratulate all concerned
 in the preparation, execution and success of the raid
 carried out by the 7th Cameron Highlanders."</p>

<p>The C.O. issued a special order congratulating
Captain W. G. Stuart, M.C., 2nd Lieuts. Semple
and Morton, Sergeant A. M'Donald, Lance-Corporal
J. Kelly and Privates G. M'Lean and
W. Marston on the gallant and conspicuous
part they took in the raid. A special order was
also issued by the Army Commander congratulating
the 44th and 46th Brigades on the
successful raids carried out during the month.</p>

<p>From the 3rd to the 7th of April the
Battalion was billeted in the cellars of the
Grand Place, Arras, preparatory to the battle.
The shelling by the enemy was now considerable,
but we only suffered two casualties. Before
the attack the Padre held a Communion Service
in one of the large cellars, in which many of
the officers and men partook. It was indeed
a unique and solemn Service. Every now and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">{73}</a></span>
then the sound of a shell bursting amongst the
houses above, or in the Grand Place, would
drown the words of the Padre and shake the
cellar. At 11.30 p.m. on the 8th the Battalion
moved from the cellars down into sewers, along
which they travelled to the communication
trenches, and so to their assembly trench in
front of the cemetery. The Battalion headquarters
were in the cellars of a house in Rue de
Douai.</p>

<p>At 3.20 a.m. on the 9th the Battalion was
reported in position ready for the attack. The
zero hour was 5.30 a.m. The attack commenced
with the 8/10th Gordons on the right,
the 9th Black Watch on the left, and the 7th
Camerons in support. The advance was carried
out behind an intense barrage. The German's
first system was gained with slight loss, the
Camerons occupying "O.G.1" and "O.G.2." At
7.30 a.m. the attack upon the second objective
was commenced. The 9th Black Watch on the
left were for a time held up at the Railway
Triangle, where there was heavy fighting, and
this also prevented the Gordons from reaching
their objective. The Camerons were then
ordered to support the assaulting battalions,
and with their assistance all objectives were
gained. About 3 p.m. the Camerons were
ordered to relieve the Black Watch on the
left. The Battalion was re-organised, "B"
and "D" Companies moving forward, two
platoons to "Hecq Trench," and two platoons to
"Helle Trench." "A" and "B" Companies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">{74}</a></span>
moved to "Cable Trench," which they started
to consolidate about 1 p.m. Orders were then
received to proceed eastwards to Feuchy, in
support of the 45th Brigade. This move was
carried out and completed by 4 p.m. Later
it was arranged that the position occupied by
us was to be taken over by the 6th Camerons
(45th Brigade), and we were to move back to
the trenches we had previously occupied. So
ended the first phase of the battle.</p>

<p>At 12.45 a.m. on the 11th we heard that the
attack was to be continued at 5 a.m. At 3 a.m.
orders came through from Brigade to move
into a position occupying part of the "Brown"
line which had been captured previously by
the 46th Brigade. This position was occupied
by "A" Company on the right, "C" Company
on the left, "B" Company right support, and
"D" Company left support. At 11 a.m. the
Companies attacked in artillery formation,
moving half-right for "Orange Hill." As soon
as the crest of the hill was reached we came
under heavy machine gun and shrapnel fire,
which for a time delayed the advance, but the
Battalion finally worked forward and occupied
a system of trenches about H29 central. About
2.54 p.m. a message reached us that the barrage
was to again commence at 2.50 p.m., and the
Brigade was to attack at 3. This gave only a
few minutes to get the necessary orders issued,
but about 3 p.m. the Battalion commenced the
attack. Once again they came under exceptionally
heavy machine gun and shrapnel fire,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">{75}</a></span>
but they succeeded in reaching a position
running roughly between Lone Copse and
Monchy. Here word was brought about 4.40
p.m. that the enemy was reported to be preparing
a counter attack, and at once everyone
was busy putting the trenches in a state of
defence. However, it was stated shortly afterwards
that the counter attack was no longer
to be expected.</p>

<p>A great portion of the Battalion entered
Monchy, where they were placed under command
of a Colonel of the Essex Yeomanry, who was
in charge of the troops there. No one who was
in Monchy is likely to forget the sight. The
casualties had been heavy amongst both
men and horses, some of the latter being
literally blown to pieces. Later, orders were
issued to O.C. Companies to withdraw and
link up with the Gordons from a line about
100 yards in front of the sunken road. This
movement being completed about 3 a.m. On
the 12th, the Battalion was relieved by a Company
of the Worcester Regiment, and moved
back into "Helle Trench," which was reached
about 5.30 a.m. There it remained till 3 p.m.,
when it was finally relieved and moved into
billets in Arras. The strength of the Battalion
taking part in these operations was 23 officers
and 521 other ranks; of these 12 officers and 175
other ranks became casualties. The officer
casualties were:&mdash;</p>

<p>We all felt very sorry for Lieuts. Semple and
Morton, as these two splendid young officers
had only on the day before the attack been
awarded the Military Cross for their conspicuous
gallantry in the raid which had taken place
a few days previously. They were killed while
the sincere congratulations of all ranks still
sounded in their ears.</p>

<p>A special order was issued by the Commander-in-Chief:&mdash;</p>

 <p class="indent nodent small">"My warmest congratulations on the important success
achieved by you yesterday. The manner in which the operations
were carried out reflects the greatest credit on Commander,
staff and troops. Please convey to all employed my
appreciation of the great skill and gallantry shown by them."</p>

<p>The Corps Commander also issued a special
order, expressing his appreciation and thanks
for the splendid work done both in the preparation
for, and execution of, the attack. He
was particularly gratified by the energy displayed
by all ranks after the third objective
was captured.</p>

<p>The Divisional Commander issued the
following special order:&mdash;</p>

 <p class="indent nodent small">"15th Divisional Commander feels sure that this generous
acknowledgment of the work of the Division will be highly
valued by all. He wishes to add his own thanks. He is proud
to have under his command a Division in which officers, N.C.O.'s
and men are inspired with so fixed a determination to do their
duty. The task given to the 15th Division in the Battle of
Arras was a very heavy one, entailing hard work in preparation
and great gallantry in attack. The difficulties of the operation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">{77}</a></span>
 only inspired all ranks to greater effort, and brilliant success
has been achieved. The crushing defeat of the enemy on 9th
April was due to the discipline, hard work, untiring energy, and
magnificent gallantry of all ranks. Another page of honour
has been added to the glorious record of the Division. The
Divisional Commander wishes to thank every officer, N.C.O. and
man, and he feels that it is indeed an honour to command the
victorious 15th Division."</p>

<p>The signallers and runners during the battle
of Arras had a severe time, owing to the heavy
shell and machine gun fire. The system of
deep buried cable had not yet been developed,
all wires being laid over the open. They were
therefore being constantly cut by shell fire, and
the signallers had to be out continually, both
night and day, repairing them. This also
necessitated the use of runners to carry messages
during the periods of the heavy bombardment.
Signallers and runners were picked men, as the
work was not only arduous and dangerous, but
required both judgment and commonsense. We
were lucky with the men chosen, as they on
this and all other occasions did their work well,
showing courage and devotion to duty.</p>

<p>At the close of this phase of the battle, Lieut.-Colonel
Crichton went down the line sick, the
command of the Battalion being taken over by
Major MacLeod. The Battalion was billeted
in Arras up till the 23rd April, re-organising
and absorbing fresh drafts. They also practised
the attack in open order, and did a certain
amount of rifle practice in the "butte de tir."
We left our billets in Grand Place on the night
of the 22nd, relieving the 8/10th Gordons. We
were to attack the enemy on the 23rd, the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span>
objective being the "Blue" line. At 3.20 a.m.
the Battalion was in position, "D" Company
being on the left, "A" Company on the right,
"B" and "C" Companies in support. On
our right were the Seaforths, on the left the
Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (45th
Brigade).</p>

<p>The zero hour was 4.45 a.m., when the
Battalion commenced to attack under a heavy
barrage. The enemy almost at once opened
a barrage on our front line, and also an intense
machine gun fire from an emplacement on our
immediate front and from the high ground on
the south side of Scarpe River. The machine
gun emplacement on our front was to have been
knocked out by our trench mortars, which
were to open rapid fire on it half a minute
before we attacked; but this scheme was not
carried into effect, and we suffered very heavy
casualties when the men got over the top and
rushed the gun at the point of the bayonet.
The fact that Lieut. Anderson, the trench
mortar officer, was killed probably accounted
for the failure of the trench mortar to knock
out the machine gun. Lieut. Anderson was a
most skilled and gallant officer, beloved by all,
and his death must have had a disconcerting
effect on his men. He was a cheery individual,
and had often rendered very valuable service
in the attack. We missed him both as a soldier
and as a man. After rushing the gun at the
point of the bayonet, our right was held up by
machine gun fire. Our left, in the meantime,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">{79}</a></span>
pushed on to Bullet Trench, seizing the south
end of it, taking about 40 prisoners and capturing
a machine gun. Here about 5.30 a.m.,
finding they were out of touch both on their
left and right, they dug themselves in. The
centre of the Battalion for a time had been held
up by the machine gun fire, but succeeded
finally in advancing and fortifying a post about
the sunken road (5.45 a.m.) A small party on
the right, with the assistance of Captain Morrison
of the Black Watch, formed another post in
the sunken road. By 10.30 a.m. those who were
holding the post in Bullet Trench had managed,
with the assistance of a few stokes and rifle
grenades, to clear the trench up to the Cambrai
Road, three posts being formed in the trenches.</p>

<p>For a time our right was insecure, as
the Black Watch, who had attacked the village
of Guemappe, had not succeeded in holding
it, and had been driven out by the enemy.
About 12 mid-day a new barrage was formed,
under which we pushed forward the posts in
the sunken road, advancing to a part of
"Hammer Trench." These posts, being on high
ground slightly in front of the village, spotted the
enemy forming up for a counter attack against
the Black Watch, and our Lewis Gunners were
able to do considerable execution before the
counter attack was broken up. The 46th Brigade
advanced through the 44th, and again
our Lewis gunners were able to do good work
in firing on the enemy as he retired from the
trenches on the right. After re-organising the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">{80}</a></span>
Battalion moved back to behind the "Brown"
line about 2 a.m. on the 24th.</p>

<p>Everyone believed we were now done with
fighting for the time being, as our casualties
had been heavy, and we were all congratulating
each other on being the lucky ones who had got
through it. Next day, however, the Commanding
Officer received orders that we were to go
back into the line in order to take Cavalry Farm
on the 26th, as another Battalion had failed
to do so. No doubt it was necessary, as there
were no fresh troops available, but no one,
unless he has done it, can realise the feelings of
a Commanding Officer when he has to order the
men to turn round and go back into the fight
under such circumstances. But he was proud
of his men who, tired as they were, once more
turned back and faced the enemy without a
grumble.</p>

<div class="image-center">

   <p>Lieut. Colonel <span class="smcap">Norman Macleod</span>, C.M.G., D.S.O.,</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Owing to casualties in the previous fighting,
we had now only three Company Officers left,
besides the Commanding Officer and Lieut.
Legate, who was acting as Adjutant. A request
was made to be allowed to bring up fresh officers
from the transport lines, but this was refused.
Unfortunately, just as the Battalion was moving
off, one of the three officers became a casualty,
leaving only two, neither of whom had been in
action before the previous day's fighting. When
we reached the lines and found that the Battalion
was to carry out the attack on Cavalry
Farm, the Commanding Officer suggested to
Brigade that he would go forward to Company
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">{81}</a></span>
Headquarters, as the Battalion had been practically
reduced to the strength of a Company,
especially in officers. However, the Brigade
would not agree to this.</p>

<p>The intention was that the Battalion was to
take Cavalry Farm and the trenches to the east
of it. The 45th Brigade were to attack to the
north of Cambrai Road, and take a German
strong point so as to protect our left, while the
Black Watch were to advance on our right
and form a line of posts. As soon as the
Battalion had captured the farm, the 9th
Pioneer Gordons were to make a communication
trench up to it. The attack commenced
at 11 p.m. We managed to capture
the farm, but on getting past it we found the
trench to the east strongly held by the enemy.
These we attacked, but almost immediately
found ourselves between two fires, coming from
the trenches in front and from machine guns
close on our left rear, situated in the strong
point which the 45th Brigade had failed to
capture. The result was that we had
to fall back on the farm. In the meantime
the Gordons, having heard that we had taken
the farm, came up to commence their trench.
They also came under the same heavy cross fire
as was holding up our advance, and had to
withdraw. The Major in Command and many
others become casualties.</p>

<p>This information being received at the Battalion
Headquarters, the Commanding Officer
decided to go forward and try to re-organise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">{82}</a></span>
the attack. The communication trench was
filled with 9th Gordons, and it became necessary
to advance over the open, which was a slow
process, as the ground was being swept by
machine guns. On reaching the front line
it was found crowded with troops, in consequence
of the Seaforths, who were in support, having
moved forward into the front line when our
Battalion had advanced to the attack. They
were now mixed up with our men who had
come back. The Seaforths were ordered to
withdraw to the support line, with the exception
of one Company which was retained to
assist us in holding the front line. It was
practically impossible to take the trenches east
of the farm unless the strong point on the north
side of the road was attacked and captured.
Having therefore formed posts in the farm and
to the right, to link up with the Black Watch,
he proceeded to the 45th Brigade Company,
who had failed to capture the strong point on the
north side of the road, and from which position
the enemy were able to fire into our rear when
we had gone forward. They informed him
that they did not intend to attack the strong
point again. This made it impossible for us to
continue the attack beyond the farm with any
chance of success. That evening the Battalion
was relieved by the Seaforths, and moved into
support. The next day the Battalion was
occupied in burying dead. This work was
difficult, as the enemy, seeing the movement,
kept up intermittent shelling. However, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">{83}</a></span>
managed to collect 64 bodies of Camerons, which
we buried in one grave. The Commanding
Officer took the service, but had to limit the
number of men present owing to the danger of
casualties from shelling.</p>

<p>In order to save space, the majority of men
were buried lying on their side. A touching
feature was the fact that someone had taken
each man's arm and put it round the body lying
next to him. From the top of the trench one
could imagine that the men were sleeping,
embraced in each other's arms, more especially
as they were buried in their kilts just as
they had fought, no blankets or other covering
being available. Altogether it was
a most moving scene. The machine gun,
which has already been referred to, and
which should have been knocked out before
the attack, had taken its toll, as most of
these bodies were found round about its emplacement.
One could well appreciate the desperate
gallantry of the men who rushed it. We had
the satisfaction, however, of knowing that
many of the enemy's gun crew had been
bayoneted by our men.</p>

<p>A good example of the grit of the young officer
and also the difficulty of obtaining accurate
information regarding casualties was experienced.
Lieut. Mackay was missing, and though
several men were certain that they had seen
him dead in a certain shell-hole, his body could
not be found. One reliable N.C.O. was so
certain of its position that he guaranteed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">{84}</a></span>
if he were allowed to go out, he would
return directly with the body. His re-request
was granted, but proved a failure.
As a matter of fact, Mackay was found
dead a considerable distance further on. He had
been severely wounded where the men saw him,
and they had been wrongly convinced that he
was dead. He had been killed finally
by a direct hit. He must have suffered severe
wounds first of all, as his right hand, which had
been blown off, and other wounds, had been
dressed. Such wounds would have more than
justified anyone going back to the dressing
station, but this brave young officer, although
stunned and wounded to such an extent that
his own men thought he was dead, had evidently
advanced with the remainder of the Battalion
as soon as he had regained consciousness.</p>

<p>During the second phase of the operations,
4 Headquarter officers, 9 Company officers,
and 570 men were engaged, of whom 7 Company
officers and 369 men became casualties. Great
praise is due to two young officers who went
through the whole of the battle (their first
engagement), and who individually led the
Battalion in the attack on Cavalry Farm. We
must refer to Captain W. G. Stuart, who was
killed on this occasion&mdash;better known as "W.G."
He came out with the Battalion in 1915, and
had taken part in all the fighting in which the
Division had been engaged. A quiet, unassuming
man, with a strong personality, he was
known and loved not only by the officers and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">{85}</a></span>
men of his own Battalion, but throughout the
Brigade. He seldom had a man of his Company
before the C.O. In fact, the apparent
pain which it gave to "W.G." to think that a
man had done anything to bring disgrace on his
beloved Company was the greatest punishment
that man could have. The men would have
done anything for him, and discipline was maintained
out of love and regard for their Captain.</p>

<p>If the Battalion on our left had succeeded
in obtaining their objective, or had at least
silenced the enemy, the attack on the farm
would probably have proved a success. On
the night of the 28/29th of April the Battalion
was relieved by the 3rd London Regiment, and
withdrew into billets in the Grand Place. The
fighting had been long and severe, and if fresh
troops had been available to go through on the
completion of the first "phase" the success might
have been even greater. At the close of the
fighting at that time one was able to move a
considerable distance forward at night without
encountering the enemy, who must have been
holding his line very lightly and far back. He
had recovered himself, however, when the second
phase started. It is interesting to read with
what surprise and despondency General Ludendorf,
the Chief of the German Staff, writes
concerning the battle. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="nodent indent small">"On that day (9th April) I celebrated my birthday. I looked
forward to the expected offensive with confidence, and was now
deeply depressed. Was this to be the result of all our care and
trouble during the past half year? A day like April the 9th
threw all calculations to the winds."</p>

<p class="nodent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
Such an expression of opinion is high praise to
the troops whose vigour and bravery brought
such a disaster to the enemy.</p>

<p>It may be remembered that at that time the
latter part of the battle of Arras was almost
over-shadowed in the press by the very gallant
and successful attack by the Canadians when
they took Vimy Ridge. It is instructive, however,
to read in General Ludendorf's Memoirs
the statement:&mdash;</p>

<p class="nodent indent small">"On the 11th they took Monchy, and during the following
night we evacuated the Vimy Ridge."</p>

<p class="nodent">So ends the battle of Arras.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 6.<br />
    THE SALIENT, 1917.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">On</span>
29th April, 1917, the Battalion moved out
of Arras to Semincourt, via Rues St. Aubert,
Denvielle, and Bernville. Here training was
carried out until the 8th, when the Battalion
moved to Grande Rullecourt. On the 21st
May the 15th Division were transferred to the
19th Corps, and moved to Vacqueril. On the
22nd they again moved to St. Georges via
Conchy and Wail. On the 6th instant, Lieut.-Colonel
Crichton officially relinquished command
of the Battalion, which was taken over by
Major MacLeod, who had been acting C.O. since
the second phase of the Battle of Arras. We
remained in St. Georges carrying out field
training till the 20th of June. This summer it
was supposed that the British had adopted the
German system of "storm troops," and that
the 15th Division was one of these. Whether
this was true or not, there is no doubt that we
were employed in all the big engagements, and
when we were not fighting we were out training
for the next attack.</p>

<p>While at St. Georges we held Brigade Sports.
Captain Lumsden, who had been acting as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">{88}</a></span>
Adjutant for some time in place of Captain A. R.
Chapman, who had been appointed Staff Captain
46th Brigade, was now confirmed in the appointment.
Captain Chapman, who was one of the
original officers, had acted as Adjutant for some
time, and by his keenness, efficiency, and good
temper had proved himself a most suitable
officer for the work. We parted with him with
regret, and wished him all success on the Staff.</p>

<p>On 18th June, Major-General Sir F. W. N.
M'Cracken, K.C.B., D.S.O., relinquished command
of the Division, and issued the following
special order:&mdash;</p>

<div class="indent small">

 <p class="nodent">"In bidding farewell to the 15th Division, I wish to express my
heartfelt thanks to all ranks for their continued assistance to me
throughout the period of over two years since I assumed Command.</p>

 <p class="nodent">"The standard of discipline and training which has enabled
the results already obtained will, I am convinced, lead in future
to still greater success. The maintenance of this standard,
added to the high sense of duty of all ranks in the Division, will
inevitably enable the same to obtain the final victory before
returning to the land of their birth, which is already so justly
proud of their fine achievements.</p>

 <p>"I shall at all times watch their movements with the
deepest interest, and I wish them every possible success in the
future."</p>

</div>

<p>It was with great regret that we parted with
General M'Cracken, who had so ably commanded
the Division since its arrival in France, and
whose ability in no little way helped to achieve
success in many hard fought battles. The
command of the Division was taken over by
Major-General H. F. Thullier, C.B., C.M.G.</p>

<p>On the 21st June we left St. Georges and
began to move northward. The first night we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">{89}</a></span>
stayed with three Companies at Croix and one
at Siracourt; next day we went on to Pernes,
and the next to Borecq, with two Companies at
Ecquedeque, where we spent the Sunday. On
the Monday we moved to Steenbecque, and from
there to St. Sylvestre Cappel. On the 27th
the Battalion went into Reserve in the 9th
Corps area, camping about two miles southwest
of Vlamertinghe. A special order was
issued by the G.O.C. 15th Division, who expressed
himself as very pleased with the march,
discipline and appearance of the Battalion. In
spite of the fact that they had no breakfast,
the long march was completed, with only one
man falling out.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of July we moved forward into
the support line via Reigersburg Chateau, "C"
Company being in "Half Moon" trench, "B"
and "D" in the Ecole, "A" Company in the
Convent Ypres, and Headquarters on the Menin
Road. This was our first experience of the
Salient, and we got a hot reception, being
heavily shelled, and suffering several casualties
while going in. In the Salient there were no
trenches, as the ground was too wet for digging,
and breastworks had to be built. From the
support we moved into the front line, with
Headquarters at Dragoon Farm, and with support
companies in St. James' trench, Milcote,
Posier defences and road. Coming out of the
line, we returned to Eerie Camp. From there
we marched to Poperinghe, trained to Arnecke,
and thence we marched again to Le Choche.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
Here we carried out training on the Rubroucke
training ground. On the 17th the Battalion
moved to Winnezele under orders of the 46th
Brigade. From there we moved to Toronto
Camp, via Watou and Poperinghe, halting for an
hour on the road for breakfast.</p>

<p>On the 23rd we once more took over the front
line with Headquarters under the railway at
South Lane, in a dug-out which was exceedingly
wet, and the men had to be kept constantly
at the pumps. That portion of the dug-out
which the C.O. and signallers occupied was
a small side shaft without any ventilation,
so that a man had to be kept at the top
of the stair pumping air down to us. As
a rule this gentleman was rather sleepy, and
had to be encouraged with powerful language.
On one occasion, however, air came blowing in
with great force. We soon discovered that some
gas shells had exploded near the mouth of the
dug-out which had effectually wakened up the
warrior at the pump, and he, with a sudden spurt
of energy, was diligently pumping the gas down.
We were now busy constructing works preparatory
to the attack, all of which had to be carefully
camouflaged.</p>

<p>On the 24th a successful little raid was carried
out by twelve other ranks of "A" Company
under command of 2nd Lieut. J. Miller. Taking
a course parallel to the railway, they found the
enemy's trenches much battered, but the wire,
though flattened, was difficult to get over.
A machine gun emplacement was discovered on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">{91}</a></span>
the railway embankment. Its crew fled,
two being killed as they were running away,
and one brought back as a prisoner carrying the
machine gun. Our casualty was one man
slightly wounded.</p>

<p>At this time we were actively patrolling every
night as well as carrying out work parties. On
the 25th we got orders for relief, but these were
cancelled later, and we were told we had to
remain in the front line. On the night of the
27/28th, orders were received that we were to
carry out a large raid on the enemy's front on
the afternoon of the 28th, two Companies being
employed in this operation. This was a very
tall order. In the first place, we had never had
an opportunity of patrolling the part of the front
over which the raid was to be carried out. On
the map, it appeared as if part of it was an old
pond. Neither did we know the condition of
the enemy's wire, etc. In addition to this the
Battalion had been in the line for some time,
and the men were therefore very tired. Further,
the time allowed for preparation was so short
that it was practically impossible to get up and
issue the usual paraphernalia for a raid.</p>

<p>The task appeared to be beyond our powers,
and the C.O. reported this to the Brigade, who
more or less agreed with him. The Brigadier
made representations to the Division, but the
answer came back that the raid had to be carried
out. No doubt this was inevitable, but it
must be remembered that it was usual for a
Battalion doing a raid of this size to be taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">{92}</a></span>
out of the line and given time to rehearse it,
examine the ground, and consider the whole
problem with the Artillery Commander, etc.
What must be, must be, and we found ourselves
with only a few hours wherein to decide on our
line of action, issue the necessary orders, and, as
far as possible, collect such stores as were available,
a somewhat difficult matter, as movement
during the day generally led to shelling. The
orders were that the raid was to go to a considerable
depth, the final objective being the
enemy's reserve lines (the first objective in the
general attack which was to take place shortly).
The raiding party consisted of "D" Company
with three platoons of "A" Company, under
command of Captain J. L. C. Jenkins. A
smaller party of 14 other ranks, under 2nd
Lieut. Elliot, were ordered to raid the railway
embankment on our right and look for a suspected
machine gun.</p>

<p>The zero hour was 7 p.m., the raiding party
being lined up at 6.45. At zero the artillery
trench mortar and machine guns opened an
intense barrage on the enemy's front, and the
raiders at the same time left our trenches and
followed the barrage. The enemy's front line
system was found to be badly knocked about,
any of the enemy who had survived the bombardment
being either killed or taken prisoners.
The raiders then pushed on over the support
lines to the reserve lines. Many of the enemy
were encountered, and these too were either killed
or taken prisoners. A machine gun was also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">{93}</a></span>
captured. The small party who raided the
railway embankment bombed a culvert and
dugout which was occupied. They did not
discover the machine gun, but they took a few
prisoners. Both parties returned, having
inflicted many casualties on the enemy and
taken 1 officer and 39 other ranks prisoners and
1 machine gun. Several other prisoners were
driven in to the Battalion on our left. Our
casualties were very slight, being 1 O.R. killed,
2 missing, and 6 wounded. 2nd Lieut. A.
Fraser and Lieut. Elliot were both wounded.</p>

<p>Altogether the raid was a huge success, which
was all the more creditable considering the
very difficult circumstances under which it was
carried out. No doubt the element of surprise
helped the result. Many raids are given away
by the preparations, especially by officers,
both Staff and Regimental, coming for days and
looking over the top in order to examine the
ground. The Battalion received warm congratulations
on the success of the raid from the
G.O.C. 15th Division. At last we were relieved
on the 29th by the 8/10th Gordons, and went
into Brigade reserve. Next evening the Battalion
moved into position of assembly for the
attack, "A" Company with two platoons at
"A.R.A." dump, 30 men at "Thatch Barn," 30
men in "Half Moon" trench, "B" Company in
"St. James' trench," "C" Company in "Half
Moon" trench, and "D" in "Hedge trench"
south of "West Lane," the Battalion Headquarters
being in South Lane. The Battalion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">{94}</a></span>
got into position without any casualties. This
was the first night that the enemy's artillery was
more or less silent, owing no doubt to the fact
that our artillery was gas shelling their batteries.
"A" Company was used for a carrying party,
the remainder of the Battalion remaining in
their assembly position until 10 a.m.</p>

<p>Shortly after zero hour, "Thatch Barn" dump
was blown up by the enemy, causing many
casualties to the carrying party. This considerably
disorganised the party and added greatly
to their work. The conditions caused by the
shelling and the muddy nature of the ground
made it impossible to carry full loads. It was
also found that the "Yukon Pack," while enabling
men to carry heavy loads, was inclined to
make them top-heavy, and on the uneven and
slippery ground they easily lost their balance and
fell. This either necessitated extra men without
packs assisting them to their feet again, or else
they had to take the packs off in order to get
up, and then reload. This caused considerable
delay. The extra weight also made the
men's feet sink deep in the mud, rendering marching
extremely difficult and exhausting. Most of
the party was made up of a draft without any
previous training with the "Yukon Pack."</p>

<p>Three out of the four Company Officers and
a Company-Sergt.-Major became casualties, the
Company being reduced to 26 other ranks.
Lieut. Mackay, who was in command, shewed
great pluck and determination in the way he
organised the parties and got the materials
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">{95}</a></span>
forward. He was wounded himself in the leg,
but insisted on going up to the forward dump
to see the work properly handed over before
going to the dressing station to have his wounds
attended to. In addition to the actual pain
involved, his wound was unfortunately saturated
with dirt, the result being that this fine
young officer died a few days later from the
effects. Besides being a good officer, he was a
splendid young fellow. He had just left one
of the great public schools and had taken a
scholarship at Oxford, which was waiting for
him on his return.</p>

<p>About 10 a.m. the remaining three companies
of the Battalion advanced and occupied the
German front system of trenches. At 1 p.m.
the Headquarters moved forward to the German
reserve lines. The enemy shelling was severe,
but they were lucky enough to find an old
German concrete machine gun post for a new
Headquarters. One platoon went forward about
2 o'clock to construct a strong point under an
R.E. officer. When they got there, however,
they found they were drawing so much shell
fire that the R.E. officer decided not to proceed
with the work. About 5 a.m. next morning
the Battalion moved forward to support, relieving
the Seaforth Highlanders, who replaced the
Black Watch in the front line, the latter taking
our place in the reserve. The position of the
Battalion now was two Companies in the Trench
immediately behind North Station Buildings,
and one Company in the strong points.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">{96}</a></span>
We were suffering considerably from the mud,
many of the rifles were almost choked with it,
and even ammunition could not be put into the
magazine without a portion of the mud on the
men's hands going in along with it. The
Commanding Officer, on going round in the
morning, insisted on getting the arms cleaned
as far as possible, a precaution which proved
itself of considerable advantage later on, for the
enemy counter-attacked about 3 p.m. Captain
Symon got his Company out in front of the
trench ready to counter-attack. This movement
was conformed to by the Company on
the left. As soon as he saw that the enemy had
broken through our front line Captain Symon
gave his orders to charge with fixed bayonets.
The enemy were driven back, and we even gained
a little ground.</p>

<p>The enemy put down a fairly heavy barrage
on our front trench and immediately behind it.
There was also a considerable amount of machine
gun and rifle fire, as well as some sniping from
a distance. We took four prisoners, and killed
many of the enemy who were seen retiring on
the hill opposite. As our right flank was now
in the air no further advance, on our part, could
be made, and we had to form a flank defence
along the Ypres-Roulers railway. The two
Companies remained in the front line. That
night we were relieved in support by the 8/10th
Gordons and took over the remainder of the
front line, which we held for the following two
days, until relieved on the night of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">{97}</a></span>
3rd/4th by two Companies of the Munster
Fusiliers.</p>

<p>During the attack we had found little use
for the Mills bomb, partly because there were
few trenches to attack, and partly because the
men had now got more confidence in their
rifles. The Rifle Grenadiers were carrying rifle
grenades in sand bags in their hands. Many of
these got lost, so that it was decided that it
would be better to carry fewer grenades in
future and that these should be worn in the
equipment, the waistcoat pattern being considered
the best for the purpose. In the counter-attack
the men fired their rifles from the hip,
which possibly had a good moral effect, although
cold steel was the deciding factor. The casualties
during the operations from the 31st July
to 3rd August were 7 officers killed, and 285
other ranks.</p>

<p>On the 4th August the Battalion moved to
Winnezwele by bus. Here we were inspected
by the G.O.C. 15th Division. We were drawn
up in three sections, the first of officers and
other ranks who took part in the operations,
the second of those who were with details, and
the third of drafts. The G.O.C. expressed his
appreciation of the excellent work performed
by the Battalion in the recent operations under
very exceptional circumstances. Here on the
14th we held regimental sports. "A" Company
was successful in winning the tug-of-war and
the "six-a-side football" match. The sergeants
beat the officers in the tug-of-war. The officers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>
however, were successful in winning the tug-of-war
against all comers from the Brigade.
The Company championship in points was as
follows:&mdash;"B" Company, 50; "A" Company,
26; "C" Company, 24; and "D" Company,
20. The best all round athlete was C.S.M.
Keith, "B" Company. At the close of the
sports, the prizes were presented by Brigadier-General
Marshall. The Divisional Band played
at intervals during the forenoon, and the massed
pipes of the Brigade played at the close of the
sports. Everything went off without a hitch,
and great credit is due to Lieut. Gibb and his
Committee for the way they arranged and
carried out the programme.</p>

<p>On the 20th we once more returned to the
line in order to continue the offensive, the
disposition of the Brigade being, 8th Seaforths
on the right, 7th Camerons on the left, and the
8/10th Gordons in support. The route taken
by the Headquarters was via Reigersberg
Chateau and No. 4 track. The Battalion, less
four platoons, proceeded via the White Chateau.
The Headquarters were in Pommern Redoubt.
The zero hour was 4.45 a.m., when the attack
was launched and carried on for about 200
yards west of Hill 35. Here the Battalion came
under very heavy machine gun and rifle fire
from Gallipoli Farm and Iberin Farm, where
they were held up. The Battalions on the right
and left also being held up, we consolidated the
position which we had gained, with the assistance
of the 8/10th Gordons, while the 9th Pioneer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span>
Gordons constructed a strong point immediately
in our rear. We held this position till
the night of the 22nd/23rd, when we were relieved
by the 9th Black Watch, and proceeded to the
support position in Rupprecht Farm, with the
Battalion Headquarters at Verlorenhock. The
next day we were relieved by the 8/10th Gordons
and proceeded to Eerie Camp. Our casualties
were, 4 officers killed, 5 officers wounded, 3
other ranks killed, and 132 wounded. The time
was now employed in re-constructing the Battalion
and carrying out preliminary training.
The Division then received orders to move
south.</p>

<p>General Sir H. P. Gough, K.C.B., Officer
Commanding the 5th Army, stated in a farewell
message to the 15th Division that "he parted
with them with great regret. The reputation
of the Division has been earned on many battlefields,
and has never stood higher than now.
He wishes it all good fortune and many further
successes in the future. Will ye no come back
again?"</p>

<p>While the Battalion was on the march for
the Wateau Area to entrain, it was inspected
by the G.O.C. of the 5th Army, who expressed
to the Commanding Officer his very high appreciation
of the work of the Battalion, and warmly
congratulated him on this account, and on the
successful raids they had carried out. It was
with no feeling of regret that we marched south
leaving the Salient behind us, where it was not
only a case of fighting the enemy, but also of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">{100}</a></span>
fighting an almost worse enemy in the elements.
It is quite impossible to describe the conditions
of that half-inundated land and the sea of mud
which was stirred up by the heavy shelling on
the ground over which we had to attack.</p>

<p>The following is a vivid description by General
Ludendorff in his "Memoirs" of the fighting
in the Salient. While written of his own Army,
it is also applicable to ours:&mdash;</p>

<div class="indent small">

 <p class="nodent">"The fifth act of the great drama in Flanders opened. Enormous
masses of ammunition, such as the human mind had never
imagined before the war, were hurled on the bodies of men
who passed a miserable existence, scattered in mud-filled shell-holes.</p>

 <p>"The horror of the shell-hole area of Verdun was surpassed.
It was no longer life at all, it was mere unspeakable suffering.
Through this world of mud the attackers dragged themselves
slowly but steadily. Caught in the advance zone, by our hail
of fire, they often collapsed. Then the mass came on again,
rifles and machine guns being jammed with mud. Man fought
against man, and only too often the mass was successful....
The enemy lost heavily. When we occupied the battlefield
in the Spring of 1918 they lay in their thousands. We knew
that the enemy suffered heavily, but we also knew he was
amazingly strong and, what was equally important, had an
extraordinary stubborn will."</p>

</div>

<p>As there were no dugouts, and the men were
living in shelters only, every tour saw a considerable
number of casualties. The enemy
had the Menin Road and other tracks carefully
taped, and the area behind the front line received
almost more attention from the enemy's
artillery than the front line itself. The Headquarters
were generally in the remains of houses
partly protected by concrete, but which would
have easily been destroyed by a direct hit. In
fact, on more than one occasion the officers at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">{101}</a></span>
Headquarters left the protection of these buildings
and sat in a field watching the enemy
bombard them. This, however, proved good
for the morale of the front line troops, who
often used to be "bucked up" at seeing the
Headquarters getting it hot.</p>

<p>The reserve billets in Ecole outside Ypres,
and the cellars of the convent in Ypres, did not
afford much comfort, for, while they were fairly
well protected, the approaches were constantly
being shelled, so that the men were more or less
confined to the cellars.</p>

<p>We were the first Division to experience the
effects of Mustard gas. When we first learned
of its power of burning the skin, it was thought
that we would probably suffer badly in the kilt.
However, it is satisfactory to know that the
kilt once again proved its efficiency as a fighting
garment. While we have no statistics, we
believe it is true that we did not suffer more
than the trousered regiments in this respect,
the reason being that it was generally the parts
of the body where the skin was tender that got
burnt. The skin of the legs having got hardened
by exposure to the weather, was generally able
to withstand the effects of gas in the same way
as the hands and face. Again, most of the cases
of burning were caused by men sitting down on
the ground which was saturated with the gas.
The kilt, being thick, the gases could not easily
penetrate it, and no doubt its swinging in the
air, when the men got up, helped to dispel them.
In fact, the men did not suffer much from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">{102}</a></span>
effects of burning unless the shell burst close
enough to sprinkle them with the liquid.</p>

<p>We regret to record the fact that within a
short time of our handing over our Headquarters
in Pommern Redoubt, which was a most unhealthy
spot, Major Murray, Commanding the
Black Watch (better known as "Haggis," and
after whom the Divisional rest camp was called),
and some of his staff, were killed by a direct hit
at the entrance of the shelter. The Headquarters,
which consisted of an old German
machine gun concrete emplacement, were very
low. We could not stand up in them. There
was no ventilation except through the door,
and when they were filled with signallers,
officers, etc., with one or two candles burning,
the heat and exhaustion of the air became
terrible. After the first phase we experienced
great difficulty in getting back the wounded, of
whom there were a great number. One must
say a word in praise of the splendid work done
on this and many other occasions by the stretcher
bearers. Lacking the excitement of fighting,
they carried on their humane work often under
heavy shell fire, always showing a splendid
example of devotion to duty. Owing to the
mud in the Salient, their work here was exceedingly
arduous as well as dangerous. It often
took four men to carry a stretcher back to the
aid post, and even then it was a slow job.
Their work, therefore, during some of the heavy
fighting was practically continuous night and
day. Often very weary, yet never complaining,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">{103}</a></span>
they doggedly carried on. Not many of them
received honours, although many well deserved
them. The mud so delayed the removal of
the wounded that some of them lay in dugouts
and shelters for a couple of days. At last the
Division sent up a large number of men under a
Colonel of the R.A.M.C., who finally got them
taken down. His energy was splendid. He
wandered about at early dawn, even in No Man's
Land, looking for the wounded in shell holes,
closely followed by his faithful little dog.</p>

<p>The Headquarters at one time were in an old
Boche strong point. Unfortunately, as it was
the only place protected, some of the men in the
trench round about it would rush to it for
shelter, whenever heavy shelling started. As
many as possible squeezed inside, but it seldom
contained all, and as it was no doubt the enemy's
target we had several casualties in the trench
outside. It was little use telling the men not
to come, for each hoped to be fortunate enough
to find room inside, and the desire for security
overmastered all else. The floor of the dugout
was a foot deep in water, which kept slowly
getting deeper as the water in the trench
increased, and its smell was horrible, as it was
partly mixed with the blood of the men killed
outside. There was only one bed, which was
occupied for the two days we were there by a
wounded officer. We all had to sit and sleep
on boxes with our feet perched on petrol tins.
The usual result of trying to sleep in this position
was that we had hardly got off when our feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
would slip from the tin into the water, wakening
us up, after which we had to start again.</p>

<p>The Adjutant, Signallers and Orderly Room
Sergeant had a trying time in carrying on their
work. One often admired the way in which
the Orderly Room Clerk performed his duties
on this and other occasions. Numerous returns
had to be sent into Brigade, operation orders,
orders for work parties and ration parties had
to be written out by him, generally in triplicate
at least. There he was stowed away in a corner,
without a table, writing on his knee with nothing
but a bag to keep his papers in, often working
late into the night by the light of a solitary
candle balanced on a piece of wood stuck into
the wall of the dug-out, yet always doing his
work efficiently and well without a grumble
or complaint.</p>

<p>The transport had some very severe experiences
also in getting up rations, which was no easy
job. Carrying parties found many difficulties.
There was a great deal of work to be done, and
therefore ration parties had to be reduced to a
minimum. In the dark it was no easy matter
to find the map locations where the rations
were dumped, as there was nothing to distinguish
one shell-hole from another. On more
than one occasion the carrying parties were so
wearied with the struggle through the mud with
heavy loads that they had to leave the rum
ration behind, a convincing proof that they were
at the last gasp.</p>

<p>Although possibly some of the Division may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
have been a little shaken by their terrible experiences
in the fighting during the third battle of
Ypres, this was not the case with the Camerons.
We had met with great success in all our raids,
we had countered the German's determined
counter-attack which had driven in our front
line, and, while we had certainly suffered heavy
casualties during the battle, we had always been
able to make ground. In the last phase many
of the officers and men had just joined the
Battalion from drafts, and their baptism was
indeed severe. We therefore marched away
with a feeling of elation, although everyone was
naturally fagged out and glad of the prospect
of a short rest from the mud and dirt.</p>

<p>It is difficult to give a general description
of the front line in France and Belgium. It
ranged from the breastworks and mud of Ypres
to the crater areas and sap heads at Hulluch;
where mines exploding were a daily occurrence,
and the dead formed part of the parapet; or
to the shell-hole area of the Somme, where the
enemy looked down on the top of us and could
get direct observation for his shell fire. Civilians
and even Staff Officers doing a tour of the
trenches were very properly sent to quiet areas,
and so often formed wrong impressions. Thus
a well known officer, who has written an account
of the life at G.H.Q., gives the following interesting
information concerning the trenches.</p>

<p class="indent nodent small">"Behind the parapet it was almost as safe, and on dry days as
pleasant, as on a marine parade. A solid fortification of sand
bags, proof against any blow except that of a big high explosive
shell, enclosed each side of a walk, drained, paved with duck
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">{106}</a></span>
boards, and lined with dug-outs, in places adorned with little
flower beds."</p>

<p>Possibly these amenities existed somewhere,
but certainly all the years we were in France we
never came across such a front line. "Big
High Explosives!" Why, it did not often
require more than a "pip squeak" to push in
the parapet! A heavy shower of rain was
sufficient to cause it to collapse from its own
weight!</p>

<p>The same writer says if he were</p>

<p class="indent nodent small">""Seeking the fit adjective that could be applied to it in its
superlative, it would certainly not be 'exciting,' nor yet 'dangerous.'
The life was exciting, and it was dangerous a little."</p>

<p>He then goes on to describe the duties as not
so dangerous as that of a policeman who has to
stop a runaway horse! He evidently never
served in a front line where for days the Boche
put down a practice barrage, or where he was
in the habit of following you along the trench
with a shower of aerial darts; or in a front line
which you knew was mined, and it was a question
whether you or he were going to be blown
up first. But enough! Let the casualty lists
for each tour in the line speak for themselves.
As for excitement, recommend us to night
patrolling with Very Lights and an active
enemy.</p>

<p>The Battalion marched from Watau at 7 a.m.
on 1st September, 1917, via Godwaers-velde,
and Cemelhof to Gaestre Railway Station, where
they entrained at 2.5 p.m. for Arras, which was
reached at 9 p.m., and marched back to billets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">{107}</a></span>
at Montenescourt. On the 7th of September
we once more entered the Arras sector, relieving
the 10/11th H.L.I. at Blangy Park. We now
settled down into this area, and a delightful
place it was after our experience in the Salient.
The park at Blangy must have contained many
fine residences. The grounds were well wooded,
although much destroyed, and there were remains
of what were formerly beautiful gardens. The
river Scarpe flows through the woods and fills
several artificial ponds, where the men were able
to spend much of their time bathing and basking
in the sun.</p>

<p>Major-General Reed, V.C., had now taken
over command of the Division, Major-General
Thulliers having received an important appointment
at home in connection with the production
of gas.</p>

<p>On the 14th October we were instructed to
send over two small fighting patrols, consisting
of 1 officer and 4 O.R.'s each. The idea was
that, while a raid was being conducted on our
right, these patrols should cross "No Man's
Land," enter the German trench, and, if possible,
seize some identifications. It was not intended
that they should search the German trench,
but simply rush over and back again. The
raid was to be assisted with a preliminary
discharge of thermite shells and a ten minutes'
bombardment with trench mortars. It was
to take place during daylight, though the
proposition to our minds did not appear very
hopeful. "No Man's Land" was fairly wide,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">{108}</a></span>
and one could be sure that the enemy would
be fully alert, as the raid on the right was bound
to attract his attention.</p>

<p>Lieut. E. D. Hoskins and Lieut. A. Chisholm
were chosen to command the raiding parties for
which there were many volunteers. The first
patrol, under Lieut. Chisholm, got over the top
and suffered 2 casualties going across "No
Man's Land." The officer was killed near the
enemy trench, and only one of the party returned.
The second party, under Lieut. Hoskins, got
safely across "No Man's Land" and were seen
to jump into the enemy trench, but none of
them ever returned. It was learned later that
Lieut. Hoskins and the others were all killed.
Out of the raiders, therefore, only one escaped.
We also sustained the further casualties of 4
killed and 6 wounded by the bombardment.
These were the only really unsuccessful raids
which the Battalion ever undertook. We felt
they were foredoomed to failure. No enemy were
going to allow a small party of four men to
walk across "No Man's Land" in broad daylight.
It is reported that Lieut. Hoskins turned
to his men before going over the top and said:
"I am a Catholic, and am going to say a petition
before going over; I don't know what you
fellows are, but I advise you also to say your
prayers, as none of us will ever come back alive."
They went across, and were all killed in the
enemy's lines, no doubt fighting as brave men
would.</p>

<p>On the 19th, "A" Company returned from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">{109}</a></span>
the third Corps Musketry Camp, where they had
been under training, and were congratulated
by the C.O. on the successful results of their
shooting. They gained the first and second
prizes both in the "rapid firing" and in the
"knockout" competitions, and they also won
the second prize in the "snap" shooting competition
for teams of six, and in the "pill box"
competition. In the 17th Corps boxing competition
Private E. Davies and Private D.
Tate both won their heats on points, these
being the only two men we entered. This was
a very creditable performance. About this
time men from the Lovat Scouts, of whom there
were a good many in the Battalion, were being
formed into a Battalion of "Observers." It
was understood they would live behind the line
as Corps troops and only have to come up to
observe from observation posts which were not
generally in the front line, and then only if the
weather was clear. Naturally there was a
rush for the job, for living behind the line with
no more night working parties was too good a
thing to miss. In the long run, however, not
many men were actually taken away from us.</p>

<p>We were glad to hear of the success of the
actions further north, and about the 20th of
November the position was so promising that
we were under orders to be prepared to move at
fifteen minutes notice, in the event of the enemy
retiring on our front. Unfortunately, however,
this never came off. During the tour in the
trenches from the 8th to the 20th of November
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">{110}</a></span>
we had a very strenuous time in improving
trenches and erecting wire. The Brigadier expressed
his appreciation of the manner in which
all ranks had carried out these duties.</p>

<p>In November Brigadier General Marshall
left the Brigade to take over an important
home appointment. He had endeared himself
to us all. Constantly in the front line in all
weather he had a practical knowledge and
sympathy with the discomforts and difficulties
which the troops had to contend with. Kindly
and most considerate yet inspiring all with
confidence by his undoubted ability and
cheerful manner, it was with great regret
that we learned of his departure.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 7.<br />
    THE BRITISH WITHDRAWAL AND GERMAN ATTACK, 28th MARCH, 1918.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">By</span>
the end of December, 1917, rumours
began to circulate regarding a great
German offensive. Everyone had to
sleep with their clothes on, all troops, even in
the reserve billets in Arras, had to "stand to"
before sun rise every morning until orders to
"stand down" were received from Brigade.
Sleeping in your clothes is never comfortable or
refreshing. Practically every night large working
parties had to be sent up to the trenches, often
not returning till the early hours, so that shortly
after the men had got comfortably settled down
they had to get up again and "stand to" fully
equipped ready to move. This "stand to"
often lasted several hours. The advantage,
therefore, which was supposed to be had in
the rest billets was much discounted.</p>

<p>We were fated once again to spend our New
Year in the trenches, but on the 2nd of January
we were relieved by 2nd Guards Brigade. We
had done our best to make the trenches as clean
as possible in order that they might take over a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">{112}</a></span>
system worthy of the Guards. It is satisfactory
to know that the G.O.C. Guards
Division informed the G.O.C. 15th Division
that he had never had such a satisfactory
take over as on this occasion from the 15th
(Scottish) Division. It was doubtful if
some of the men appreciated the hard fighting
qualities of the Guards Brigade, looking upon
them as show troops. This is exemplified by a
story of a rather dirty Jock who was baling
mud out of a trench. One of the splendid clean
Guardsmen, who had come up as orderly with
some officers, tried to get into conversation with
him by remarking that they were coming up to
relieve them. The muddy Jock asked him,
"Who are ye?" and he replied, "Oh, we are
the Guards," and the Jock, proceeding with his
digging, rejoined: "Ah! weel! ye can write
hame an' tell yer mither ye've seen the
sodjers."</p>

<p>On relief the Battalion went into billets in
the Ecole des Jeunes Filles. Here on the 9th
and 10th the Battalion had their Christmas
dinners, which were a great success and much
enjoyed. During the proceedings the C.O.
addressed the troops and gave a brief review of
the operations which the Battalion had taken
part in during the past year, also the new honours
they had won for the regiment. He wished
them all the best of luck for the coming year.
We must record the very great kindness and
assistance shewn us by Mademoiselle G. Marmier,
who always did all she could to add to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">{113}</a></span>
comforts of the troops. On this occasion she
made many fine paper flowers to decorate the
Christmas dinner tables with. After the dinners
the men were entertained in the theatre, where
"the Jocks," our Divisional troupe, performed
the pantomime "Robinson Crusoe."</p>

<p>The weather was now very cold, in fact when
we handed over to the Guards the ground was
deep in snow. On the 23rd February we
carried out a small raid on the enemy's trenches
at 3.30 a.m. The party consisted of 28 other
ranks of "A" Company under command of
2nd Lieut. A. R. M'Donald. The raid proved a
success. The German trenches were found to
be unoccupied, but 4 men were caught in a sap
head, one of whom was killed and 3 brought back
as prisoners, so we succeeded in getting the
identification which was required. Our casualties
were nil. For this we received the congratulations
of both the Corps and Brigade
Commanders.</p>

<p>We now fully expected an attack by the Boche,
and everyone was kept on the strain, working
hard in preparing belts of wire and improving
trench systems. For many weeks neither officers
nor men had their clothes off, and the work in
the reserve area was almost as strenuous as in
the front line. We knew that the Germans had
been successful further south, and we were
holding what was becoming an acute salient.
One can quite understand the nervousness of
those behind the line, but those in the front areas
were confident of their powers to resist the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">{114}</a></span>
Boches and in the strength of the defensive
systems. On the occasion when the Guards
relieved us one of their officers was much impressed
with the serious spirit with which he
found the Staff behind the line treating the
matter. After going round the front line,
however, he remarked that the cheerfulness of
the troops had put new heart into him.</p>

<p>Indeed, the front line troops (probably in their
ignorance) treated the anxiety of those behind
with a good deal of levity. An amusing method
of dealing with the rumours flying around called
the Thermometer game was invented. This
consisted in assigning so many degrees or
marks to the person reporting a "windy" story
according to its source. Whoever got 100
degrees first won. For instance, a terrible
story from the cook's mate or transport men
was valued at about 10 points; from a brigade-major
about two, and a higher staff officer
about one.</p>

<p>The Staff, it is to be feared, did not appreciate
this chaff, and orders were issued that Regimental
Officers were not to refer to the Staff as
having the "wind up," as they were only taking
necessary precautions. However, it shewed the
troops were in good spirits.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 22/23rd of March we
were surprised to receive an order that we were
to withdraw with all stores to the Army line, the
movement to be completed by 3 a.m. The
Battalion happened to be occupying La Fosse
Farm with the caves below, and also the strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">{115}</a></span>
points. We had, therefore, a considerable
amount of ammunition, etc., in the part of the
line held by us. Further, we were instructed
to guard our right flank carefully. As we knew
that the enemy had driven in the line further
south of us, this warning was appreciated.
"D" Company, who were occupying Fork,
Spade, and Gordon Trenches, were to be left
behind to fight the rear guard actions when the
Boche discovered we had withdrawn. O.C.
"D" Company also had orders to destroy the
Headquarters dug-out at Crater Subway, and
the electric lighting plant in the Fosse Farm
was to be rendered unworkable. Over and
above this, R.E.'s were to blow a mine placed
under the Cambrai Road.</p>

<p>As soon as it was dark motor lorries and
vehicles of all descriptions were brought up to
the farm, and we at once started loading them.
Luckily for us there was a Y.M.C.A. Canteen
in the caves, the officers in charge of which left
it when they heard we were retiring. The C.O.,
taking advantage of this, allowed every man
who brought down a box of ammunition from
the strong points to help himself to cigarettes.
With this encouragement, men carrying ammunition
came back in quick succession, and by the
time we finally retired, about 3.30 a.m., all
ammunition trench stores, etc., with the exception
of a few gum boots, had been loaded and
withdrawn.</p>

<p>It was difficult to understand how the Boche
did not hear the noise of the retiral. If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">{116}</a></span>
he had done so, and had trained his guns on the
Cambrai Road, he would have caused endless
confusion and casualties. The road was simply
packed with motor lorries, guns and vehicles
of all descriptions, with the retiring infantry
dodging in and out between them. The congestion
was extremely bad at the cross roads
at Tilloy, where the different streams of traffic
met. While recognising that this movement
was necessary from a military point of view,
still it was hard to persuade the men to see this,
almost as difficult as it is for anyone who was not
there to realise their disappointment and surprise.
They had worked hard for months in preparing
this position. They had carried up tons of
wire and constructed belts of it many yards wide.
They now felt all this work had gone for nothing.
Supremely confident that they would have held
this position against all odds, they regretted
that they had not an opportunity of proving
it. They evidently did not appreciate the
dangers of an exposed flank. We got into our
new position shortly before sunrise, and from
there we could see our artillery, in the morning
light, still getting back their guns, but the
enemy was not even then aware of the
movement.</p>

<p>We knew that an attack by the Germans was
almost inevitable. All preparations possible
were being made, and it was easy to understand
the importance of the orders that the ground
we held must be "held at all costs." While it is
true that there were many defensive lines behind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">{117}</a></span>
us, right back almost to the sea, yet we
believed that there were practically no troops
in our immediate support to man them, so that,
if the Boche once more broke through us, it was
likely to prove a disaster. Furthermore, if
our position was lost the enemy would outflank
Vimy Ridge, which would probably necessitate
our withdrawing from it. We had gone
through a long spell of hard work in the trenches,
and had been kept in a state of suspense for
several months without a chance of ever getting
our clothes off. The men, however, were in good
fettle, but the Battalion contained a number of
young lads from 18½ to 19, who had been
sent out in drafts in the early Spring. They
had not been proved in battle or seen any
action, and it was impossible to say how
they might act, although we had every
confidence in them.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 27th March the Brigadier
visited our Battalion Headquarters with the
joyful news that it looked as if the Boche had
given up the idea of attacking us meantime, as
he was moving his guns from their battery
positions, presumably with the intention of
taking them somewhere else. Unfortunately
this conclusion proved wrong, for in reality
they must have been taking their guns
out to move them into position for the attack.
When the Brigadier left, the C.O. went round
the front line with the good news. He remained
in the front line till about 2 a.m. Just as he
was leaving, a post reported that a short time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span>
earlier they had discovered a party of Boche in
front of our wire, apparently cutting it.
They had been driven off with a Lewis gun, and
had not been seen since. On examining the
wire, which was a fairly broad belt, there were
certainly signs that this had been their
intention.</p>

<p>About 3 a.m. on the 28th, the enemy
opened an intense bombardment on our front
and immediate support lines, using gas shells
on the left Company's front, south of Cambrai
Road. This had lasted for about half an hour,
when the bombardment was moved on to the
back area, including the town of Arras. It was
learnt afterwards that this was largely composed
of gas shells. About 4 a.m. the bombardment
of the front line having become less, the officer
on duty patrolled the whole of the left Company's
front up to the Cambrai Road, afterwards
returning to the right, when he reported
that the whole Company were standing to.
There had been a fair number of casualties.
Once again our front was heavily bombarded,
mostly with trench mortars. This bombardment
was exceedingly severe, especially on the
left, south of the Cambrai Road. The N.C.O.
who was on duty (the officer on duty having
been killed) stated afterwards that he had again
tried to patrol his front, but found the trenches
so flattened that it was hard to say where they
had been, and the ground resembled a ploughed
field. He believed nearly everyone in this
sector was either killed, buried or wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">{119}</a></span>
At 5.15 a.m. the enemy again put down a very
intense trench mortar barrage on the left, which
probably killed any men left in the front
trench south of the Cambrai Road. At
the same time the enemy could be seen
jumping from shell-hole to shell-hole in front
of Le Fosse Farm. We now fired S.O.S. signals,
and opened rapid fire on the enemy. On the
centre of our front line the enemy were about
100 yards away in front of the wire. The men
in this part of the line afterwards stated that
they were still confident that they could hold
them up. Suddenly, however, it was seen that
the enemy were working round our flank. An
attempt was at once made to form a flank
defence, but the casualties had been so great
that this was found impossible, and practically
no officers were left. Those remaining, therefore,
had to fall back rapidly. So quickly did
the enemy come round the flank that the
signallers and others in the advance Battalion
Headquarters (old 44th Brigade) were not
able to get out in time to escape.</p>

<p>The extreme right of the Battalion had also
been severely shelled along with the left of the 3rd
Division. Here, too, the enemy broke through.
From the Battalion Headquarters we now saw
the lines of the 3rd Division front being driven
back, and shortly afterwards our own men
were seen retiring. The officer on the right had
thrown back a platoon to try and form a flank
defence, but soon found the enemy working
round his rear and forcing him to withdraw.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span>
The withdrawal was carried out in an orderly
fashion, a covering fire being kept up with Lewis
guns and rifles, the men behaving splendidly,
which says a lot for their morale, as by this
time most of the officers had been killed, and
it must be remembered that many of the
men were young recruits who had just come
through their first experience of a hurricane
bombardment.</p>

<p>At no time was the shelling so severe on the
centre of our line as it was on the flanks. It is more
than probable that the bombardment was so
withering that the men on the flanks were wiped
out before the enemy attacked. This seems to
be proved by the fact that no officer or man
belonging to the three platoons on the left or
the platoon on the right, and only 1 man of the
next two platoons, returned; in other words, only
7 men returned out of 6 platoons. The smoke
and dust were such, however, that no one could
see more than a few yards, and in any case
it was impossible for us to see what was
occurring to the north of the Cambrai Road,
as at this point it is raised by an embankment.</p>

<p>The front line Companies Headquarters were
in machine gun nest dug-outs in front of our
wire. They were rushed early in the attack.
No-man's-land certainly was a bad place for
Company Headquarters, but there was no
better location available. By 8.15 a.m.
we had formed a new front line running
north along the switch line, being in touch
with the 8/10th Gordons on our right and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">{121}</a></span>
the 6th Camerons on our left. By this
time there were probably not more than
150 other ranks and 3 Company officers remaining.
As, however, the 6th Camerons were on
our left, some of the men naturally got intermixed
with them. The Battalion Headquarters
were by this time in the front line, and all the
Headquarter officers and men were used in the
defence of the line. It was one of the advantages
of having the Battalion Headquarters
worked more or less on the principle of a Company,
that this was so easily carried out: each
Headquarter officer had his own section of men,
and the men knew under whose command they
had to place themselves.</p>

<p>The C.O. now consulted with Captain
Wood, commanding the Company of the
8/10th Gordons, who at once took in hand
the collection of ammunition, which was
rather short in the new trench, from the dump
at Shamrock Corner and the old trench systems.
This distribution was successfully carried out.
It is only right that we should refer to the
splendid assistance given to us by Captain
Wood. He was one of the few remaining
officers who came out with the Division. He
therefore had a wide experience in fighting, and
shewed as usual that coolness, disregard for
danger, and sound judgment with which we all
associate him.</p>

<p>After the consultation the C.O. decided to try
and counter-attack the enemy and establish a
line along the old support trench in the Brown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">{122}</a></span>
Line. We sent off messages asking for artillery
support for 9.30 a.m., when we proposed making
the counter-attack. We could not get Brigade
on the 'phone, the wires having probably been
cut. We sent off pigeons, but the bombardment
had been too much for them, and it was only
after considerable amount of stone throwing
that we got them to fly at all. We sent messages
also with the buzzer set, but the annoying thing
about both pigeon and power buzzer messages
is, that one never knows whether they
have been received or not. The artillery support
never came, and we held back the counter
attack till 10.30, as we did not wish to advance
in case we should walk into our own fire. As
a matter of fact not one of our messages ever
got through.</p>

<p>About 10.30 a.m. the C.O. received a message
from the O.C. "A" Company 6th Camerons,
who were on our left, stating that his flank was
now in the air, and that the enemy were as far
back as Feuchy Chapel Crossroads on his left
and rear, and he asked what he should do.
Instruction were sent him to try to form a
flank defence so as to get in touch on his left,
but to hold his ground at all costs whatever
happened. This information definitely decided
us to give up the idea of counter-attacking.
In order to get a clear idea of the situation,
the C.O. went along the front line to the 6th
Camerons, and found they were holding the
front in good strength. There was not
much doing in their immediate front, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">{123}</a></span>
evidently some of the enemy had penetrated
along the Cambrai Road to their left rear.
Three Vickers gun teams which were in the trench
were instructed to get into position where they
could defend the flank, if necessary. On returning
to the Battalion he ordered a certain number
of men to get back into the strong points directly
behind the line, and thus increased the depth of
our defence.</p>

<p>About 1 p.m., as the line was now well
organised, the Headquarters were withdrawn
to those of the 8/10th Gordons. The instructions
issued previously were that if the
front line went the Headquarters were
to withdraw immediately. As it turned
out, however, it was not possible to withdraw
the Headquarters earlier, as they had to be used
in the defence of the line. Almost as soon as
we arrived (1.30 p.m.) orders were received
that the whole line was to be withdrawn to
the "Army" line, and instructions were sent
forward accordingly. Orders afterwards came
through that we were to hold the position we
had, but by the time they arrived we had
already moved back. The Headquarters were
again withdrawn to those of the Reserve Battalion
(8th Seaforths), and shortly afterwards
we withdrew the Battalion to some old trenches.
Lieut. Gibb, however, and a few men remained
with the 8/10th Gordons, and during the afternoon
this party accounted for many casualties
amongst the enemy by sniping them with the
Lewis gun which had been attached to Headquarters.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></span>
At 1 o'clock in the morning we
received orders that what remained of the
Battalion were to go back and join the Transport
at Wanquetim. We could not muster
more than 30. Only one Company Officer
got back. Some more men came in next
morning, but the total number that returned
from the fight never reached 100. Luckily,
several officers and men who had been left out at
the transport line form a nucleus round which
to reconstruct the Battalion.</p>

<p>To sum up: the enemy's barrage fire successfully
annihilated our right and left flank,
the evident intention being to surround those
left in the centre. All the officers of the front
Company being casualties, the line was methodically
withdrawn under N.C.O.'s. The support
Companies had more or less the same experience.
No officer or other rank returned from the
platoons on the flanks, and out of the 4 Companies
1 officer and about 150 other ranks returned to
the switch line. The men at all times shewed a
good fighting spirit. The rapid fire, together
with the subsequent sniping which was brought to
bear on the enemy must have caused him heavy
casualties. It was noticed early in the fight
that the enemy brought up a light gun with
pack animals. He also mounted several machine
guns, which caused heavy casualties when the
line was withdrawn from the switch line. The
total casualties for the day were:&mdash;</p>

<div class="misc">
<ul>
 <li>Officers, 3 killed, 3 wounded, 10 missing.</li>
 <li>Other Ranks, 1 killed, 72 wounded, 299 missing.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">{125}</a></span>
The number of officers and other ranks returned as
killed and wounded is small, but most of the
missing turned out afterwards to be either
killed or wounded.</p>

<p>During this fighting our Medical Officer,
Captain A. C. Bateman, M.C., was killed.
Among personalities connected with the Battalion
there was none more striking or lovable
than "the Doc." Posted in the early months
of 1916, he served continuously with us until
the fateful 28th March, 1918, when he was
reported as having been wounded and taken
prisoner by the enemy. As no more was
heard of him after that date it can only be
inferred that he succumbed to his injuries,
and gave up his brave life in the service of
his country. As a Battalion Medical Officer
he was unrivalled, and his ability in diagnosis
and treatment was widely commented on by
all ranks. Sympathetic and kindly to "lame
dogs," and to the "nervy," he was a terror to
"lead-swingers." Providence seemed to have
endowed him with a special faculty for discovering
these. In a battle he was ever in
the thick of things doing his duty, and more
than his duty. It therefore gave high satisfaction
in all quarters when he was awarded
the Military Cross in recognition of the
gallantry and efficiency he displayed at Ypres
in July, 1917.</p>

<p>But all who knew him will think of him
first as the best of comrades&mdash;a very prince
of good fellows. His rich Hibernian humour,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">{126}</a></span>
his infectious laugh, his droll ways were unfailing
medicaments for weary men, and in
every social gathering he was the life and soul
of the company. One wonders if the French
War Office has it on record how two British
doctors who had been enjoying Paris leave,
and were in danger of being late in rejoining
their units, solemnly presented their compliments
to the Minister of War, along with a
polite request that they might without delay
have the use of a car to take them to Albert.
On the request being acceded to that dignitary
was warmly shaken by the hand, and
assured that no want of his, if made known
to them, would go unsupplied! Such was
Bateman. Irrepressibly gay when all around
him was dismal and difficult, he brought sunshine
into our lives, and as often as men of
the 7th Battalion meet together his name is
sure to be mentioned in terms of affectionate
praise.</p>

<p>The engagement was probably the heaviest
fight the Battalion ever took part in. One
realised the difference between attacking and
being attacked. We felt all the horrible uncertainty
as to what would be the result of the
next move by the enemy. We believed there was
practically no one between us and the sea, and
that we had to hold the position at all costs.
Nobly did the officers and men carry out these
instructions. Unfortunately, as was proved
later, practically all the missing were never
heard of again, only some 50 or 60 were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">{127}</a></span>
accounted for as prisoners, and most of these
were wounded.</p>

<p>We know now, through General Ludendorf's
<i>Memoirs</i>, that it was the failure of the German
Divisions at Arras that brought their big
offensive to a standstill. It is interesting to
read his description and to note how it coincides
with our experience. He states:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent nodent small">"At the shortest range the artillery was to be supplemented
by trench mortars. After a short artillery bombardment, lasting
only a few hours, the infantry should advance to the assault.
This short artillery preparation was expected to paralyze the
enemy's artillery by means of gas spread over a large area and
to keep his infantry in their dug-outs. At the beginning of the
assault the artillery, while continuing to keep down that
of the enemy, was to put down a barrage in front of the infantry
and pave a way for it like a giant roller. The infantry had
to keep close up to this wall of projectors. The enemy, who would
come out of his dug-out after the barrage had passed, would be,
surprised by our infantry, assisted by 'auxiliary' or companion
arms under the protection of artillery.... We had 20 to 30
more Divisions than the enemy. We thought of carrying out the
attack with 50 or 60 Divisions. The Army had thrown off its
depression. Morale was completely restored, and we intended
starting a War movement. If the blow at the centre succeeded
the strategic results might indeed be enormous, as we should
separate the bulk of the English Army from the French and
crowd it up with its back to the sea.... The 17th Army was
to capture the decisive heights East and North of Arras. I
attached the greatest importance to this attack, to have the high
ground in our possession was bound to be decisive in any fighting
in the plain of the Lys. In spite of employing extraordinary
masses of artillery and ammunition, the attack of
the 17th Army on both banks of the Scarpe was a failure."</p>

<p>To shew the amount of artillery sometimes
used, apart from trench mortars, he states in
another place:&mdash;</p>

 <p class="indent nodent small">"In the offensive battle it was necessary to bring up a 100
 guns to each kilometre (1100 yards) of front."</p>

<p class="nodent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">{128}</a></span>
The following day the C.O. received the following
letters:&mdash;</p>

 <div class="indent small">

<p class="nodent">"<span class="smcap">My dear Colonel</span>,</p>

<p class="nodent">"A hurried line to tell you that, while I feel most keenly
your heavy losses, I cannot sufficiently express to you my
humble thanks for the gallantry and devotion shewn by
your Battalion yesterday under your leadership. If you have
a moment, let me know any details of losses. I cannot come
to see you, or, needless to say, I would. I may say that the
Corps C.O. says the Division has, it is hoped, saved Arras,
and I know that the 7th Cameron Highlanders bore the
hardest share of the fight.</p>

that the 15th Division was practically saved from destruction,
or, at any rate, an ignominous retreat. I would like you to
convey to all ranks of your Battalion my sincerest sympathy
with them in the great struggle. The Divisional Commander
to-day, in expressing his thanks for the work of the 44th

Arras.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">{129}</a></span>
The Battalion was now reduced in numbers
to one Company, made up mostly from the
reserves at the Transport lines which had been
left out of the trenches. Consequently we had
one Company of the 9th Gordons attached to
us, and three days later (1st April) we were again
holding the trenches in rear of the intermediate
Army line, which we started to put in a state of
defence. We soon received drafts, which began
to increase our strength, but there were no
officers with them. One fully realises the difficulties
with which the Staff had to contend,
and the last thing anyone wants to do is to
reflect in any way on their hard work and
wonderful organisation. At the same time, we
feel that the system of posting officers and men
at the Base was not the best that could have
been devised. This was brought home to us
on this occasion. We were very short of
officers, and on the Division asking for drafts
we were informed that there were no Cameron
officers available, and that if we insisted on
having officers we would have to take them
from other units, a thing the C.O. always
objected to. Within a few days we received a
letter from an officer with the home Battalion
who was anxious to try and get re-posted
to the 7th. In his letter he stated that
there was such an enormous number of
officers with the Reserve Units they could
hardly find room to put them all up! The
letter was brought to the notice of the
Division, and the result was that in a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">{130}</a></span>
short time we had a draft of Cameron officers
on their way to us.</p>

<p>On the 26th the Brigade was relieved by the
176th Brigade, and we withdrew to Berneville,
via Dainville and Warlus, in motor lorries. We
were now leaving the 17th Corps area, and the
following communication was received from
the Corps Commander addressed to the C.O.C.
15th Division:&mdash;</p>

<div class="indent small">

<p class="nodent">"I wish to express to you and all ranks in the Division my
great regret at your departure from the 17th Corps, in which you
have been incorporated for many months, and I had hoped
that we might have seen the battle through together. That,
however, is not to be, and I only hope that the fortune of war
may some day bring us together again. The Division has a
great reputation, and may well be proud of it. I know that
the honour of Scotland is safe in its keeping, and that those
now serving will prove themselves worthy of those men who
have won glory for the Division in the past. I wish you all
good luck and success from the bottom of my heart.</p>

<p>On the 26th we moved by motor bus to
Auchel. On the 1st May the G.O.C. inspected
the Battalion and presented medals. In a short
address to the Brigade he thanked all ranks for
their work and devotion to duty while in the
Arras sector, and dwelt particularly on their
splendid work on the 28th in repelling the
German attack. The following was sent from
the G.O.C. 44th Brigade to O.C. 7th Camerons:&mdash;</p>

<div class="indent small">

<p class="nodent">"I wish to thank you and all ranks of your Battalion for their
excellent behaviour and smart appearance the whole time

gratifying to you to know that the Divisional Commander,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">{131}</a></span>
 during the parade yesterday, told me that he considered the
44th Brigade the best command in France, and that he had
never seen smarter or cleaner men in any village during the
war than the 7th Cameron Highlanders. I would like you to
notify all ranks of the Divisional Commander's high appreciation
of their successful efforts to keep up the credit of the
44th Brigade.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 8.<br />
    AMALGAMATION OF 6th AND 7th CAMERON HIGHLANDERS.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">On</span>
the 4th of May the Brigade moved to the
17th Corps Area. The Camerons proceeded
by march route to Calonne-Ricouart, where they
entrained and proceeded to Acq. From here
they proceeded to "Y" huts, Etrun, by march
route, the transport moving by road. On the
6th we proceeded into support camps. We
spent our time between the front lines and the
reserve camps up to the 10th of June, when we
were withdrawn back once more into Arras.
These support camps, Collingwood, Trafalgar,
and Portsmouth, were originally constructed
by the Naval Brigade, who made a very fine
job of it. They were, however, now under
observation by the enemy, and we were shelled
now and again. We luckily sustained no casualties
in them, but some of the other battalions
were not so fortunate.</p>

<p>At times we also occupied the huts built on
the side of the railway embankment. These
were very comfortable, for, being on a steep
slope, they were always dry, and it was almost
impossible for the enemy to hit them. We were
also bivouacked beside the old ponds and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">{133}</a></span>
gardens of Blangy Park. The weather was very
warm, and both officers and men thoroughly
enjoyed another spell of bathing and basking in
the sun. The scene had the appearance of
some picture by an old master with its tall trees,
grassy banks and sunny pools, where naked
gods reclined and bathed. Sometimes a shell
would fall amongst us, but luckily they never did
any harm, as they generally hit the water or
buried themselves in the soft ground. The next
occupants, however, received more attention
from the Boche, and were inclined to blame us for
too much movement. The true cause of this
was not our movements, but the fact that a
battery of artillery was brought up into the
woods near the ponds before we left.</p>

<p>During one of our spells in the trenches
about this time we removed a large gun from a
German concrete battery position in the front
area, which had been captured during the
Battle of Arras. All the work had to be done
at night by hand labour, and as the gun was a
considerable weight it was some job, but we
finally got it out and towed it back over the
grass. It is a peculiar old French gun made of
brass. It had been rebored by the Germans
and fitted with a 5.9 tube. We finally got it
sent home as a trophy along with its carriage.
We were asked to lend it to the War Trophy's
Exhibition in London, but decided instead
to present it to the town of Inverness, as the
capital of the Highlands, and also as a proof
that we had not forgotten the many kindnesses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">{134}</a></span>
the Battalion received there before it came out,
and there it now lies.</p>

<p>On going back into Arras we received with
much regret the information that, owing to the
shortage of men and recruits, a large number of
units were to be amalgamated. As we were the
Junior Battalion of the Cameron Highlanders,
it was decided that we should unite with the
6th Battalion. It is hardly necessary to say
that this news was very far from welcome, not
that we had anything against the 6th, but
because the 7th Battalion, which had made such
a name for itself, was to cease to exist. It was
decided by the G.O.C. Division that the O.C.
of the 7th Battalion should take over the command
of the 6th, and he also gave permission
for him to transfer what officers and men he
might desire. This was a great concession, as
originally the order had been that only the
deficiencies in officers and men of the Senior
Battalion should be made up. The decision
was a sound one, as by this means a splendid
Battalion was constructed.</p>

<p>The remains of the 7th Battalion were to be
made into a training Battalion for the American
Army. It was, therefore, possible for officers and
men, who were either war worn or had seen a considerable
amount of fighting, and deserved
a rest from the fighting area, to be sent
with the training cadre. This left a large
number of officers and men to be disposed of,
and it was no easy task to decide whom to keep
and whom to let go. The C.O. was much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">{135}</a></span>
touched with the devotion and loyalty to the
Battalion shown by many. Wherever he went
he would be waylaid by anxious applicants,
who would beseech him to keep them, some
even with tears in their eyes, for, although
it was promised that any who might be
sent to the base would be kept as drafts
for the Camerons only, still they had had
so many experiences of similar promises they
did not believe it. Their disbelief proved
eventually to be well founded, for many of them
were finally transferred to other units. It was a
trying time. Everyone who was remaining
had, so far as possible, to put on a cheery
countenance and to argue that it was all for
the best, still many of them felt the parting
with old comrades and tried friends as much
as those who had to leave.</p>

<p>On the 10th June the C.O. said farewell to
those of the Battalion proceeding to join the
39th Cadre Division to provide a training staff
for the U.S.A. Army. It was a sad moment,
which certainly he and probably many others
who were present will never forget. The transport,
of which Captain Mauchlin was so justly
proud, was ordered to proceed to the base.
Many exchanges took place with friendly transport
officers in the Division, so that the transport
which left our lines for the base, under Captain
Mauchlin, was transformed into a collection of
the most ordinary looking horses drawing limbers
and waggons very far short of the splendid
transport of the 7th Camerons. No sadder man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">{136}</a></span>
left the Battalion than the transport officer.
He had a great knowledge of his work, and took
keen interest in his transport, which, by his
untiring energy, had been brought to a high
state of efficiency.</p>

<p>The following officers were transferred from
the 7th to the 6th Battalion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="misc small">

<ul>
 <li>Lieut.-Colonel <span class="smcap">N. MacLeod</span>, D.S.O., to Command.</li>
 <li>Major <span class="smcap">R. M'F. Cram</span>, Second in Command.</li>
 <li>Captain <span class="smcap">T. Orr</span>, M.C.</li>
 <li>Lieut. <span class="smcap">J. R. Park</span>.</li>
 <li>Lieut. <span class="smcap">R. A. M. MacCrostie</span>.</li>
 <li>Lieut. <span class="smcap">R. C. Hamilton</span>.</li>
 <li>Lieut. <span class="smcap">E. J. G. Gibb</span>, M.C.</li>

 <li>Lieut. <span class="smcap">D. Stewart</span>.</li>
 <li>Lieut. <span class="smcap">D. Wishart</span>.</li>
 <li>Lieut. <span class="smcap">E. P. B. Cameron</span>.</li>
 <li>Lieut. <span class="smcap">R. S. D. Pollock</span>.</li>
 <li>2nd. Lieut. <span class="smcap">P. Austin</span>.</li>
 <li>2nd. Lieut. <span class="smcap">R. C. Mitchell</span>.</li>
 <li>2nd. Lieut. <span class="smcap">J. R. Cran</span>.</li>
 <li>2nd. Lieut. <span class="smcap">P. F. Prentice</span>.</li>
 <li>2nd. Lieut. <span class="smcap">A. Banks</span>.</li>
 <li>2nd. Lieut. <span class="smcap">H. T. Macbeth</span>.</li>
 <li>2nd. Lieut. <span class="smcap">M. T. H. Wilson</span>.</li>
 <li>2nd. Lieut. <span class="smcap">A. King</span>.</li>
 <li>2nd. Lieut. <span class="smcap">J. Hogg</span>, and</li>
 <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;383 Other Ranks.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>Of these the C.O. was the only original officer
who had joined in September, 1914, and proceeded
overseas with the Battalion as Captain
Commanding "B" Company. In addition to
him there were about ten men who had embarked
with the Battalion in July, 1915.</p>

<p>Thus does the official history of the 7th
Battalion come to an end. It might be as well,
however, before closing, to follow roughly the
training Battalion's movements until it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">{137}</a></span>
broken up, and also to refer shortly to the
doings of the 6th Battalion, which now contained
many of the 7th.</p>

<p>The training staff proceeded to Calais, via
Hazebrouck, where they were affiliated to the
3rd Battalion 119th Regiment A.E.F. They
at once entered upon their duties as instructors,
which they carried on up to the 2nd July, when
the American Division left the area, and the
training staff moved to Veuse. Here they
carried on instructional training lectures. On
the 25th they moved to Watten for the 7th
Corps Reinforcement Camps. On the 30th
they proceeded to Arneke, where they were
joined by a Battalion of Reinforcements for
the 51st Division, and worked on the back area
in the 2nd Army Front, the Battalion being
called the 19th Corps Reinforcement Battalion.
From Arneke they went to St. Eloi area. They
occupied different camps in this area, some of
them being very bad. On the 7th, 348 other
ranks, conducted by 6 officers, left for the 51st
Division, and the remainder of the reinforcements
and the cadre moved into billets at La
Cloche. On the 9th the remainder of the reinforcements
were ordered to rejoin the 51st
Division, and orders were received that what
remained of the 7th Camerons training staff
had been placed at the disposal of the D.A.G.
for reinforcements. On the 12th of August
orders came to return to the 39th Division to
billets in Listergaux. On the 13th August instructions
were given that the 7th Cameron Highlanders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">{138}</a></span>
training staff should be broken up, all
officers and other ranks who remained being sent
as reinforcements to the 6th Battalion, with the
exception of Lieut.-Colonel Anderson, who took
over command of the 8th Seaforths and the
Adjutant and Orderly Room Sergeant, who were
sent to Rouen Base to wind up and check
records, all stores being handed into Ordnance.</p>

<p>Something must also be said of the 6th
Battalion which, as has already been stated,
now included many officers and men from the
7th Battalion. The amalgamation was carried
out most satisfactorily. The C.O. addressed
both units separately, and made a special appeal
to both officers and men not to discuss and
compare the merits and doings in the past of
the two Battalions which were now united, but
to remember that they all belonged to the same
famous regiment, and that it was up to them
to pull together, and so maintain the high name
which both Battalions had already created.
Everyone backed him up most willingly,
the result being that there was not a single
instance of crime arising from disputes between
the men of the different Battalions. This is
all the more creditable when it is remembered
that there was considerable unpleasantness in
some of the other units which were amalgamated.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 9.<br />
    BUZANCY.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">The</span>
6th Battalion remained in the Arras
sector till the beginning of July, when
we were at last taken out of the line.
We moved back, and it was believed that we
were going to have that long rest which we so
much deserved, and to which we had been
looking forward ever since we arrived in France.
We had been in the fighting area practically
since the end of the previous year, a period of
about seven months, which included heavy
fighting. We were certain that we were in for a
long rest when we entrained. We steamed
off south, and our hopes became still higher as
the report got about that we were going to one
of the big French training areas in the south of
France. We heard it was an ideal spot, and a
health resort even before the war. However,
after steaming some distance past Amiens, the
train suddenly stopped, and we were ordered
to get out and proceed to billets. Our faith
began to be shaken in the gentleman who talked
about the seaside in the south. It was still
more shaken the next day when the Battalions
were embussed and proceeded in the direction
of the front line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">{140}</a></span>
On the 18th of July we found ourselves under
the command of the 3rd French Army. On the
19th we moved into the Montigny area, and on
the 23rd we relieved the first American Division
and held the left sector of the 20th Corps. We
took over the line on the night of the 22/23rd,
and received orders that we were to attack
the next morning (23rd) on the high ground on
the west bank of the Criscuart at Misse. The
C.O. hurried forward in the afternoon, and had
a look round the line. The Americans had
suffered heavy casualties, and the ground was
strewn with their dead. The Battalion came
in that evening, and the relief was carried out
without much difficulty. There was some confusion
as to the exact location of our front line,
which apparently did not tally with that shewn
by the maps taken over. However, there was
no time to make even a preliminary reconnaissance.
The zero hour was fixed for 5 a.m. The
C.O. and Adjutant moved back to Brigade Headquarters,
as up to midnight no orders had been
received for the attack. The C.O.'s of the other
units of the Brigade were also there. The
operation orders did not come in till about 3 a.m.
There was just time to issue the Battalion
operation orders, but it was quite impossible
to instruct Company officers or others in person.</p>

<p>The attack commenced at 5 a.m. with the
6th Camerons on the right, the Argylls on the
left, and the Royal Scots in support. Everything
went well to begin with, although we
came under very heavy machine gun fire. Our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">{141}</a></span>
barrage did not prove of much use, as the official
front line given to us was found to be considerably
in advance of that actually held. We advanced
a considerable distance and took a sugar
factory. We had suffered severe casualties in
consequence of the barrage, leaving some German
machine guns untouched. The attack took
place down a steep bluff, then across the valley
(which was intersected by a railway embankment),
and the river, and up steep rising ground
on the other side. We managed to get forward
fairly well, although encountering strong opposition
from the enemy. We took the railway
embankment and river, including "Sucrerie."
Our left flank, however, was in the air by this
time, as we could not get into touch with the
Argylls on our left. We extended in order to
try and link up with them, but finally discovered
they had come under heavy fire and had
not been able to advance. The result was that
for a time we had practically held the whole
brigade front. About 6 p.m. the enemy put
down a heavy barrage and launched a strong
counter-attack, but this was successfully repulsed.
We were to have attacked the village
of Buzancy on the morning of the 24th, but
this was postponed.</p>

<p>Owing to the pronounced salient held by the
Division at the "Sucrerie," it was decided to
withdraw and occupy the line of the railway.
The fighting was of an open order nature,
through fields of grain and small woods, with
machine guns firing from behind hedges instead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">{142}</a></span>
of out of the usual trenches. On the 27th we
received orders for the Division to make an
attack on Buzancy and the high ground to the
east of the village. The fighting was again
severe, and ended with our taking Buzancy.
There was exceedingly bitter fighting round the
grenade works, and the enemy put up very
strong counter-attacks. Owing to the non-success
of the 87th French Division on our right,
we had finally to withdraw to the line of the
Chateau.</p>

<p>On the 30th or the 31st July it was decided
that the 45th Brigade would attack the main
Soissons road from Villemontoire. About 10.45
a.m. we had more or less reached our objectives,
although the others had been slightly held up
by heavy machine gun fire. Our right flank
was now in the air, as we could not get into
touch with the K.O.S.B.'s. Meantime we
formed a defensive flank along the road from
the cemetery to the Soissons road. The S.O.S.
went up from the 12th Division about 2.45 p.m.
and also from the original front line. A pitiless
machine gun fire was experienced from the
wooded hills on the right. Evidently the Germans
had raided the 12th Division's lines, and
we heard later that they had taken some
prisoners. About 10.35 a.m. on the 2nd August
strong patrols which had pushed out found
that the enemy was retiring, and we got orders
to swing our right forward so as to keep in
touch with the 44th Brigade. About 3.30 p.m.
the Brigade reached the edge of the Concrois
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">{143}</a></span>
wood. At 7.50 the next objective was given
as the river Crise about Nilleblain. On the
night of the 2/3rd we were relieved by the 17th
(French) Division, and on the 4th we embussed
for Leincourt.</p>

<p>So came to an end our tour with the French
and American Armies. The following is an

<p class="nodent">"Mon General,</p>

<p>"After relieving your Division in the pursuit on the Vesle,
I established my Headquarters at Buzancy. I found there the
traces still fresh of the exploits of your Scottish soldiers, and
the officers of my staff were able to see clearly what hard fighting
you had had to gain possession of the village, and, above all,
of the park.</p>

<p>"Wishing to leave on the spot some lasting tribute to the
bravery of your soldiers, I entrusted to one of my officers,
Lieut. Rene Puaux, the task of erecting there, with the
material at hand, a small monument emblematic of the homage
and admiration of my Division for yours.</p>

<p>"This monument has on it 'a medallion' on which are
inscribed thistles and roses, and beneath, the words:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">'<i>Here the noble thistle of Scotland will flourish forever among
the roses of France.</i>'</p>

                  '<i>15th</i> (<i>Scottish</i>) <i>Division</i>.'</p>

<p>"This monument was erected on the highest point of the
plateau, where we found the body of the Scottish soldier who
advanced the farthest (on 28th July, 1918&mdash;Buzancy).</p>

<p>"The photograph of this monument has appeared in the
last number of the journal <i>L'Illustration</i>. I thought you
would be glad to have a few copies of the photograph, which
I send you herewith. They convey to you, together with the
memories which I have kept of our short meeting at Vierzy,

<p>"You entered the battle at its fiercest moment. The
enemy, already once vanquished, again brought up against
us his best Divisions, considerably outnumbering our own.</p>

<p>"You continued to advance step by step, in spite of his
desperate resistance, and you held the ground won in spite of
his violent counter-attacks.</p>

<p>"Then during the whole day of the 1st of August, side by
side with your French comrades, you stormed the ridge dominating
the whole country between the Aisne and the Ourcq,
which the defenders had received orders to hold at all costs.</p>

<p>"Having failed in his attempt to retake the ridge with his
last reserves, the enemy had to beat a retreat pursued and
harassed for 12 kilometres.</p>

<p>"All of you, English and Scottish, young soldiers and
veterans of Flanders and Palestine, you have shewn the magnificent
qualities of your race: courage and imperturbable
tenacity.</p>

<p class="date">"MANGIN."</p>

</div>

<p>The monument at Buzancy is, we believe,
unique as being the only monument raised by the
French Army to British troops during the war.</p>

<p>We must refer to the excellent staff arrangements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">{146}</a></span>
for bussing troops which the French had
made. Our usual experience had been that
when one was ordered to embus at a certain hour,
the busses never turned up for a considerable
time afterwards. In fact, on our way down the
bussing and training arrangements were several
hours behind the scheduled time-table. With
the French, however, on each occasion the busses
turned up a few minutes before the hour they
were due, so that we had no delay. We also had
an officer in a motor car taking charge of the
convoy of busses. This enabled him to move
about and see that no distance was lost, also
to go ahead and regulate traffic at important
cross roads. Another good arrangement they
had was having one or two empty busses at
the end of each column, so that if a bus broke
down it was drawn to one side, and the men
speedily transferred to an empty bus. So the
whole column was kept together.</p>

<p>We now moved north to the Loos sector,
and it was very interesting once more going
over the old ground. We took part in the final
general advance from this area. After the
Armistice we were informed that we were one
of the Divisions that had been chosen for the
Army of Occupation, and we busily prepared
indents for new clothing, etc., in order to make a
good impression. It was decided, however,
that the young Battalions who had come out
from home should take over this duty. We
were finally billeted in Braine le Comte. Here
we instituted a Battalion Mess. We had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">{147}</a></span>
always been in the habit of doing this wherever
possible. No doubt many officers preferred
the small Company messes, but from a disciplinary
and many other points of view the Battalion
mess had many advantages. Certainly our
mess proved a great success.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 10.<br />
    DEMOBILISATION.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">The</span>
6th Battalion was one of the Battalions
chosen to represent the 15th
Division in the march past before the
King of the Belgians and the Duke of York&mdash;the
Earl of Inverness&mdash;in Brussels. We were
the guests of the town of Brussels for the three
days we were there, and everyone enjoyed their
visit. The men were billeted in good houses,
and both they and the officers thoroughly
enjoyed the theatres and dancing halls. Their
behaviour was exemplary, and when the Battalion
"fell in" to march home there was not
a single man absent. The parade itself was
greatly spoilt by a snow storm. We also
arranged for each Company to visit the field of
Waterloo, a short lecture being given beforehand
on the battle. The men displayed keen
interest, especially in the panorama on which
they could see the square with the 79th. We
were all struck with the smallness of the battlefield,
and the enormous number of men that
must have been crowded into this space. The
whole area would probably not have been more
than a two-battalion front in one of our late
battles.</p>

<p>Orders were that drills were to be reduced to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">{149}</a></span>
minimum, and that education classes for the
men were to be started. This education scheme,
however, was not a very great success, as we
never received any supplies of books or any
other material for carrying it out. The French
class proved very popular, probably because
everyone wanted to be able to converse with the
inhabitants, especially the young ladies. In
order to employ the men and keep them fit,
we took up athletics very keenly. There were
several good athletes who had formerly been
prize winners both in the 6th and 7th. Once
again we managed to prove ourselves the
best Battalion in this respect. Every officer
and man had to belong to a team, and there is
no doubt that the officers taking a keen interest
in the games made all the difference in the
results.</p>

<p>Our football team won both in the Brigade
and Division contests, and had a very tough
fight before they were beaten in the Corps.
At the end of the first game we were all level,
so we played another half hour. As this resulted
in another draw, we had a replay, which also
proved undecisive, so that we had again to play
extra time, in which both teams scored a goal.
On the 3rd replay we were unfortunately beaten
by one goal to nothing. As our opponents
were the Liverpool Scottish, the defeat
was somewhat softened. The match was
intensely exciting, both for players and
spectators. Our cross country team was
our greatest success, winning not only the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">{150}</a></span>
Brigade, Division, and Corps Cups, but finally
establishing themselves as "Army" Champions.
We also had a strong boxing team, which won
the Brigade cup, and one of our men was the
runner up in the "Army" Championship lightweights.
In the final he was against a much
bigger and stronger lad than himself. He was
all out in the third round, but he put up such a
plucky fight that the referee recommended the
Committee to award him a second prize, which
they duly did.</p>

<p>With us, as with other units, the demobilisation
caused a certain amount of dissatisfaction,
owing to the fact that the system of demobilising
by "trades" and "districts" enabled many
men who had only served a few months to get
home before others who had been out for long
periods. The Cadre of the Battalion set out
for home on the 7th June. We proceeded to
Inverness with the Colours, which were duly
deposited at the Cameron Depot. The Colour
party was received by the Provost and others,
and played up to the Depot by the Band. The
following day Mr. Barron, brother of the late
Major Barron of the 7th, who was killed at Loos,
entertained the whole Cadre to lunch, a kindness
which we all highly appreciated. We then
proceeded to Kinross, where we were finally
demobilised.</p>

<p>The Colours of the 7th Battalion were "presented"
at the Depot during the Northern
meeting in 1920 by the Duke of York, Earl of
Inverness, and Hon. Colonel of the 4th Battalion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">{151}</a></span>
On that day the Regiment held a reunion parade
at which many men who had formerly served
in the Battalion were present. After the presentation
we all marched through the town,
the salute being taken by the Duke of York,
who was accompanied by The Mackintosh of
Mackintosh, Lord Lieutenant of the County,
and Lieut.-General Sir Spencer Ewart, K.C.B.
On the Sunday the Colours of both the 6th and
the 7th were marched by a Guard of Honour
to the High Church, the Parish Church of
Inverness, and handed over by Lieut.-Colonel
N. Macleod, Cameron Highlanders, for safe
custody, to the Minister and Provost as representing
the Session and Heritors.</p>

<p>So ends the history of the 7th Battalion, better
known as the "Shiny 7th." They received
this name because of the great care that was
taken by all ranks in their cleanliness and
appearance. Even in the front line every man
polished his buttons, brushed his boots and
cleaned his equipment every day. No doubt
this was irksome to a few, but the large majority
of the men took a keen pride in themselves.</p>

<p>The shortage of water did not prevent our
men from shaving, and on many occasions,
when water could not be got, they reserved a
little of their tea for this purpose. There is no
doubt about the "morale" effect of keeping
clean, and men always feel better for it. Further,
it occupied their spare time and so kept their
minds from meditating upon their unpleasant
surroundings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">{152}</a></span>
This is no new discovery, for one reads that
when Sir John Moore started to train men in
Ireland for the Peninsular War, one of the first
things he did was to encourage the men to clean
themselves and take up athletics so as to keep
them out of "pot houses" and to increase their
morale. It is also interesting to read in Ludendorff's
memoirs that one of the chief causes
he assigns for the loss of discipline and morale
amongst the soldiers of the German Army was
the filthy conditions in which they had to live
in the trenches, and the impossibility of getting
the men to clean themselves. Certainly, from
the appearance of prisoners, the Hun paid little
attention to cleanliness in the front line areas.</p>

<p>Our "Q" side also had a good deal to do
with the morale, as by the system on which we
worked everything possible was done for the
comfort of the men. Men who were always
detached from their companies, such as those in
the Transport lines and at Battalion Headquarters,
had N.C.O.'s told off to act as Q.M.S.
for the detachment. They also had their own
cooks, and the officer in charge of them was made
responsible for their comfort and welfare. On
one occasion Battalion Commanders were called
to a conference to discuss the organisation of a
Battalion with a General Officer from G.H.Q.
We all went full of wrinkles learnt from practical
experience, but as soon as the first suggestion
was put forward the General got up and stated
that a Battalion must consist of four Companies
of four platoons each, to which every man and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">{153}</a></span>
officer must belong, and he would not listen to
any discussion as to proposals for Headquarter
Companies, etc. In theory we all maintained
the four Companies, yet circumstances made it
essential there should be Headquarter detachments.</p>

<p>Our Headquarters were divided into platoons
or sections, each under an officer, with a senior
officer in command of the whole. Thus signallers
were under the Signalling Officer, runners
and observers under the Observation Officer.
Each section had its own battle position in
defence of Headquarters, and "stood to"
morning and evening in these positions under
the command of their officers. If Headquarter
rations had been left to the four Companies to
provide, and there had been no fighting organisation,
it would have led not only to great
discomfort but to considerable danger, in the
event of a successful attack by the enemy, such
indeed as that which occurred in March, 1918.
One is glad to know that this fact was generally
realised towards the end of the war by Higher
Authority. It was often found difficult for
old serving soldiers, especially Q.M.'s, to change
the routine which has almost grown a part of
themselves, but in the 7th Battalion we were
lucky in having able Q.M.'s, who were always
willing to adopt any scheme that was for the
comfort of the men.</p>

<p>We cannot close these notes without
stating our profound and deep respect for
the officers, non-commissioned officers and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">{154}</a></span>
men who served along with us in this splendid
Battalion. They suffered appalling
hardships, especially in winter, living in trenches
half filled with freezing mud, often without a
shelter; they performed prodigious feats of
work for long hours and for days on end; they
advanced and conquered despite the most
terrible barrages, the men carrying on by themselves
after their officers and senior non-commissioned
officers had become casualties;
they had, moreover, successfully withstood
the shock of one of the most terrific attacks
which the Germans were able to bring
against them. Again and again the Battalion
was annihilated, but there were always
plenty of recruits ready to uphold the honour
of the Regiment. As was once said of
the Cameron Highlanders in another great war:
"Such troops may be annihilated, they can
never be defeated." Nothing better reflects
the fine spirit of the young men of Scotland,
and their patriotic decision to defend their
country at all costs, than the fact that the heavy
casualty lists proved the best recruiting sergeant.
Justly proud in the knowledge that time cannot
wither, nor the centuries deface, the glorious
memory of these heroic achievements, every
officer, non-commissioned officer and man,
whose honour it was to serve with the
7th Battalion, derives his highest pleasure
and his truest satisfaction from the reflection
that he performed his duty; that he "did
his best" in the most critical period which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">{155}</a></span>
homeland has ever been called upon to face,
and that he and his comrades have written a
golden page well worthy of its place in the noble
records of their famous and beloved Regiment,

by the distinguished War Artist, Joseph Gray. It was commissioned
by Evan M. Barron, Esq., Inverness, as a Memorial
to the Battalion of which his brother, Major James Barron, was
second-in-command when he fell at the Battle of Loos, on 25th
September, 1915. The incident depicted by the artist is thus
described by Mr. John Buchan in <i>Nelson's History of the War</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="buchan">

 <p>"Lieutenant-Colonel Sandilands of the 7th Camerons
 arrived on the Hill. Being the Senior Officer present, he
 took command and planted the headquarters' flag of his
 Battalion on the top. It was his business to recall the van
 of the advance, now lost in the fog and smoke of the eastern
 slopes, and to entrench himself on the summit. The Redoubt
 was now out of our hands, and the line taken ran just under
 the crest on the west, and was continued north of Loos by
 the 46th Brigade. To retire the van was no light task.
 Two officers, whose names deserve to be remembered, Major
 Crichton of the 10th Gordons, and Major Barron of the 7th
 Camerons, volunteered for the desperate mission. They
 fell in the task, but the order reached the stragglers, and
 they began to fight their way back. In the midst of encircling
 fire it was a forlorn hope, and few returned to the
 British lines on the Hill. All down the slopes towards Lens
 lay the tartans, Gordon and Black Watch, Seaforth and
 Cameron, like the drift left on the shore when the tide has
 ebbed."</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
